This re -\\nsearch includes essential elements of  under -\\nstanding empathy as a whole. Paper’s start -\\ning point is the review of  the beginning of  \\nempathy approach, as well as contemporary \\ndefinitions and areas of  empathy. The most \\ncommon distinction between components \\nof  empathy in various studies is affective em-\\npathy vs. cognitive empathy, so these com -\\nponents are specifically explained having in \\nmind that empathy integrates both compo -\\nnents. Many important phenomena similar to \\nempathy are also explained. Clearer under -\\nstanding of  empathy includes overview of  its \\nevolutionary and neuroscience background \\nas well as other factors related to empathy \\n(neurochemical, contextual, personality, and \\npsychopatological). Since the beginning of  \\nempathy research, empathy measures have \\nalso developed, and are enlisted in this paper. \\nDepending on whether empathy is defined as \\na personality trait, ability, virtue or a process, \\npossibilities of  developing empathic abilities \\nthrough training is discussed. Although most \\nresearchers pointed out the positive side of  \\nempathy, there are some that highlight the \\nother side of  empathy, which we also ana -\\nlyzed. Finally it is important to point out the \\nfuture empirical issues in empathy research \\nfield.\\n1. The beginnings of empathy research\\nEven though empathy was a concept in \\nwhich various scientists outside psychology \\nhave been involved with, psychological as -\\npect of  empathy came into focus when the \\nconcept of  empathy was defined from psy-\\nchological point of  view. Late in the 19th cen-\\ntury, as German aesthetics moved from the \\nobjective world to the working of  the mind \\nas accounting for the essential feature of  hu-\\nman aesthetic contemplation of  the world, in \\n1873, Robert Vischer suggested the term Ein-\\nfühlung , the predecessor of  empathy, to mean \\nhumans’ spontaneous projection of  real psy-\\nchic feeling in to the people and things they \\nperceive [1]. In the beginning of  20th century \\n(in 1903), Lipps developed Einfühlung theory \\nfor psychology “from a psychological, non-\\nmetaphysical perspective” and through “a \\nphenomenological method”. He believed that \\npeople knew and responded to each other \\nthrough Einfühlung, which was preceded by \\nprojection and imitation, and that as imitation \\nof  affect increases, Einfühlung increases [1]. \\nThe term empathy was coined by Titchen-\\ner [2] as a rendering of  Einfühlung, which he \\ndefined as “process of  humanizing objects, \\nof  reading or feeling ourselves into them” \\n[3]. A reactive-projective perspective and an \\nemphasis on perceptive awareness of  anoth-\\ner person’s affect or sharing of  feelings were \\napparent in this view [1]. The word empathy \\nderives from Old Greek - μπαθεια (εν – in + \\nπαθεια – feeling, emotion).\\nHusserl describes empathy as intersubjec-\\ntivity, a capacity that emerges through putting \\nourselves into the shoes of  others [4]. The \\nword, intersubjectivity, describing the main \\nreality of  empathy as an encounter between \\ntwo subjects, is extremely important. Empa -\\nthy denotes a specific form of  basic inten-\\ntional experience, as Husserl [5] argues: “The \\nintentionality in one’s own ego that leads into \\nthe foreign ego is the so-called empathy“. \\nStein [6], a student of  Husserl’s, similarly de-\\nscribes empathy as a process by which “for -\\neign subjects and their experience are given \\nto us, [we take them in, and as a result] for -'),\n",

For \\nher, people are innately open and receptive to \\none another; we absorb each other’s thoughts \\nand feelings, and in so doing make them our \\nown. Stein defines empathy as an experience \\nsui generis, which she describes „as the experi -\\nence ( Erfahrung) of  foreign consciousness in \\ngeneral“ [7]. \\nEmpathy theories in psychology were \\nlargely influenced by the aforementioned ap-\\nproaches up until Mead [8], whose definition \\nof  empathy is considered one of  the basic \\nones today, describes it as an ability to under -\\nstand other person’s situation (taking the role \\nof  the other). Mead saw empathy as a willing -\\nness or tendency to put one-self  in another \\nperson’s place and to modify one’s behavior \\nas a result. He recognized the self-other dif -\\nferentiation in empathy and added a cognitive \\ncomponent, an ability to understand, to em -\\npathize. He also argued that the role-taking \\nability is the key variable in moral growth [1, \\n9]. The person who is capable of  imagining a \\ncertain situation becomes aware of  the pos -\\nsible consequences of  that behavior for other \\npeople, and that also makes him capable of  \\nmoral responsibility. Taking others into con -\\nsideration and pondering about their feelings \\nand thoughts is a vital part of  the process of  \\nempathy. \\nEmpathy became a very important con -\\ncept for psychotherapists and counseling \\npsychologists, especially for psychoanalytic \\nand humanistic theorists. In psychoanalytic \\ntheory empathy is seen as a part of  therapy \\ncure [10]. Freud [11] wrote that empathy is \\nessential in taking perspective of  the other \\nperson’s mental life and it’s a process that has \\nan important role in our understanding of  \\nwhat is inherently foreign to our ego in oth -\\ner people. Empathy is putting self  into the \\nother person’s shoes, either consciously and \\nunconsciously [12]. Fenichel [13] views em -\\npathy as a process which includes two acts, \\nfirst, an identification with the other person, \\nand the second, an awareness of  one’s own \\nfeelings after the identification and an aware-\\nness of  others feelings [14]. Kohut defines \\nempathy as a method used in psychoanalyti -\\ncal research, pointing out the fact that being \\nempathic in therapist-patient relationship is \\nnot enough to improve someone’s situation. \\nEmpathy is merely a sign of  an adequate \\ntherapy action within therapist-patient re -\\nlationship, and it also helps the therapist to \\nprogress in the direction which may be help -\\nful [15]. He defines empathy as “vicarious in-\\ntrospection” [16, 10]. Beres and Arlow [17] \\nsay that a therapist would be able to empa -\\nthize with their patient’s feelings only if  and \\nwhen he could become consciously aware of  \\nthe patient’s unconscious wishes, conflicts, \\nfantasies, and other mental contents [12]. Ac -\\ncording to Basch [18] some analysts believe \\nthat empathy involves resonating with the pa -\\ntient’s unconscious feelings and experiences \\nwithin them, while the integrity of  therapist’s \\nself  remains intact [12]. \\nIn humanistic psychology, the meaning of  \\nempathy is taken into serious consideration, \\nand thanks to Rogers’s influence [19, 20, 21], \\nempathy has been approached by research -\\ners with scientific methods. Rogers [22] per -\\nceives empathy as a necessary and sufficient \\ncondition for psychological change, has been \\na key concept in understanding why and how \\ntherapy works, and has been seen as a way of  \\nknowing and understanding another person \\nor an object. The therapist uses empathy to \\nunderstand the client’s mental state and at -\\ntempts to communicate that experience. He \\nalso explains empathy by describing an em -\\npathic person as seeing the situation “as if  \\none were the other person” [22].'),\n",

First group of  theorists refer \\nto empathy as a personality trait or ability: to \\nknow another person inner experiences or to \\nperceive the emotions of  the other person. \\nThe implicit assumption underlying this view \\nis that some individuals are more empathic \\nthan others, either by nature or through devel-\\nopment [23-29, 9, 30, 8]. These authors have \\ndefined empathy by using terms such as “em-\\npathic disposition” [9], “interpersonal orien -\\ntation” [21], “responsiveness to the feelings \\nof  another person” [31], and “dispositional \\nempathy” [32]. Second group of  theorists saw \\nempathy as a situation specific cognitive-af-\\nfective state [33, 34, 35, 29, 19-22]. From this \\nperspective, empathy is commonly defined as \\nresponding “vicariously” to a stimulus of  the \\nother person [36-38], assessing other’s private \\nworld as if  it were one’s own [22, 39], a match \\nbetween the observer’s and the other person’s \\naffect or cognition [40,38], or the degree to \\nwhich a therapist understands and feels client \\nexperiences [33, 41, 39]. The underlying im -\\nplicit theory for this consideration of  empa -\\nthy is that regardless of  one’s developmental \\nlevel of  empathy, empathic experience varies \\nby the situation. Third group of  theorists are \\nconcerned with how empathy is experienced \\nby therapists and clients in given situations \\nhave conceptualized empathy as a multi-\\nphased experiential process. They consider \\nthe moment-to-moment experience of  em -\\npathy and examine the processes involved in \\nproducing and communicating an empathic \\nstate [33, 18, 42, 29, 37, 43, 24]. Barrett-Len -\\nnard’s [33] cyclical model (identifying three \\nphases of  empathy: empathic resonation, \\nexpressed empathy, and received empathy), \\nRogers’s [44] “temporarily living in” process \\n(involving sensing the client’s inner world and \\ncommunicating that sensing), Kohut’s [45] \\ntwo-step empathy in psychoanalytic cure (un-\\nderstanding-explaining sequence), and Glad -\\nstein’s [46] “multistage interpersonal process” \\n(including emotional contagion, identifica-\\ntion, and role-taking). This view of  empathy \\nimplies that empathy involves a sequence of  \\nexperiences. For better understanding, it is \\nnecessary to avoid using the general term of  \\nempathy and use instead the specific terms \\nof  dispositional empathy, empathic experi -\\nence, and empathic process to specify which \\nconstruct is being referred to.\\n2. A contemporary approach to \\ndefining empathy\\nIn contemporary scientific approach, em-\\npathy is the major topic of  social, develop -\\nmental, and personality psychology as well as \\nother disciplines, such as neuroscience, clini-\\ncal psychology, psychotherapy, and various \\nhealth professions [47]. Empathy is very com-\\nplex and multidimensional phenomenon. It is \\nviewed as an interpersonal process and indi -\\nvidual ability [48], as a personality trait [49], as \\ncapacity or competency [50], as response or \\nreaction to observing another’s experiences \\n[51], and as interpersonal behavior [52]. It is \\nalso described as knowledge that changes the \\nempathic person, brings new sympathy, new \\nfeelings, as well as new cognition and other \\nforms of  intersubjectivity [53].\\nIt is of  great importance of  integrative \\nempathy approach which connected folklore \\nconception of  empathy with explanations of-\\nfered by social psychology, developmental \\nsciences and neuroscience. Authors conjoin \\nsocial and cognitive psychology terminology \\nof  empathy in order to connect them with \\nneuroscience more easily [12]. Singer and'),\n",

They claimed \\nthat a lot of  research in social psychology \\nhad been studying which perceptive, emo -\\ntional and cognitive mechanisms helped peo -\\nple to put themselves into others’ shoes. Af -\\nter a while, neuroscience started to deal with \\nthe same subject with all complexity of  this \\npsychological phenomenon, as well as with \\nmethodological challenges of  putting this \\nsensitive and socially dependent concept to \\nscientific framework. Some of  the challenges \\ninclude the ability to both control, and repeat \\nexperiments. \\nThe important quantitative review and \\nconceptual analysis of  empathy gave Hall \\nand Schwartz [47] which used random selec -\\ntion method to analyze 393 studies published \\nbetween 2001 and 2013, and 96 studies pub -\\nlished in 2017. They found that empathy is \\nmost commonly seen as a multidimensional \\nconcept divisible into dimensions, facets, fac -\\ntors, types, subscales, substrates, processes, \\naspects, etc. From 2001 to 2013 33% of  the \\nauthors cited multidimensionality while in \\n2017 it increased to 52%. In 2017, among just \\nthose authors who gave a conceptual defini -\\ntion, 76% cited multidimensionality using the \\nmost common distinction between affective \\nand cognitive empathy. The conceptual defi-\\nnitions that were provided varied enormously \\nwhich illustrates that authors fundamentally \\ndisagreed on what warrants the label “empa -\\nthy.” Some authors gave definitions of  em-\\npathy with one defining feature such as pro -\\nsocial concern for others welfare, sympathy, \\nunderstanding others feelings. The second \\ngroup of  authors gave definitions with two \\ndefining features, such as sharing and under-\\nstanding others feelings, ability to understand \\nothers feelings and perspective, and ability to \\nrespond to affective experience of  the oth -\\ner person. And finally, there are definitions \\nwith more than two defining features, such \\nas experiencing others emotions, perspective \\ntaking, prosocial concern, acting compas -\\nsionately or otherwise appropriately to the \\nsituation, accurate perception of  others emo -\\ntions and other states.\\nIt is safe to say that the term empathy is \\napplied to various phenomena which cover a \\nbroad spectrum from feeling of  concern for \\nother people that create a motivation to help \\nthem, experiencing emotions that match the \\nother person’s emotions, knowing what the \\nother is thinking or feeling, to blurring the \\nline between self  and the other [14]. There -\\nfore, empathy is not an exclusive phenome -\\nnon, meaning all or nothing, but is more like -\\nly made of  different forms and intensities of  \\nshowing and experiencing empathy, ranging \\nfrom simply being affected by others distress \\nto completely understanding them and fore -\\nseeing the possible consequences [55].\\nDecety and Jackson [12] described three \\nfunctional components of  empathy which \\ndynamically interact to produce the experi -\\nence of  empathy. First, affective component, \\nwhich includes sharing emotions; second, the \\nawareness of  self  and the other with specif -\\nic mechanisms for differentiate between the \\ntwo, and third, cognitive component includ -\\ning understanding others perspective. Lamm, \\nRütgen and Wagner [56] claim that empathy \\nmeans isomorphic emotion sharing, which \\nmay be caused either by direct observation, \\nor by pure imagination of  others emotions, \\nmeaning that the empathic person is aware \\nof  the fact that the source of  such emotions \\nare within the other person. \\nBatson [57] enlisted eight aspects of  em -\\npathy: 1. Knowing another person’s inter -\\nnal state, including thoughts and feelings; 2. \\nAdopting the posture or matching the neural \\nresponses of  an observed other; 3. Coming'),\n",

Feeling distress at \\nwitnessing another person’s suffering; and 8. \\nFeeling for another person who is suffering.\\n2.1. Components of empathy\\nIn a number of  studies empathy has been \\nidentified as primarily an affective phenom -\\nenon (affective empathy), referring to the im-\\nmediate experience of  the emotions of  the \\nother person, as primarily cognitive phenom-\\nenon (cognitive empathy), referring to the in-\\ntellectual understanding of  others experience, \\nand a third view holds that empathy contains \\nboth affective and cognitive components.\\n2.1.1. Affective empathy\\nSome definitions of  empathy include only \\nits affective component, for example, “A \\nsense of  similarity between the feelings one \\nexperience and those expressed by others” \\n[55]; “affective state, caused by sharing of  the \\nemotions or sensory states of  another per -\\nson” [58]. This aspect of  empathy focuses on \\nemotional processes of  empathy and defines \\nit through experiencing and sharing emotions. \\nDiscussing affective empathy implies being \\naware of  the complexity of  human emotions \\nwhich ranges from the most beautiful to the \\nmost difficult human states. Although most \\nstudies deal with cognitive aspect of  empa -\\nthy, the etymology of  the word implies that \\nits nature surpasses pure cognition and also \\nrefers to others emotional state which is re -\\nlated to one’s adjustment to social environ -\\nment and surroundings [59]. Raboteg-Šarić \\n[60] describes empathy as emotion coupling \\nbetween one’s feelings and of  the other, and \\nstates that many researchers agree that affec-\\ntive component is what is inherent in empa -\\nthy. \\nEmpathy includes both negative feelings, \\nwhich are more frequently studied [61], and \\npositive feelings [62]. Empathic happiness is \\ndescribed as “the tendency to vicariously ex -\\nperience feelings of  goodwill and pleasure in \\nresponse to someone else’s display of  posi -\\ntive emotion“[62]. According to Walter [63], \\nthe concept of  affective empathy includes the \\nfollowing features: “a) an affective state that \\nis b) elicited by the perceived, imagined, or in-\\nferred state of  the affective state of  another; \\nc) is similar (isomorphic) to others affective \\nstate; d) is oriented towards the other; and e) \\nincluding at least some cognitive apprecia -\\ntion of  the other’s affective state, comprising \\nperspective taking, self-other distinction, and \\nknowledge of  the causal relation between the \\nself  and the other’s affective state”. \\nThe advantage of  focusing on emotion \\nsharing is in the possibility of  measuring \\nthem empirically and to put them in correla -\\ntion with neural processes. That can only be \\napplied to certain emotions, such as pain, suf-\\nfering, disgust, confusion, pride, shame, and \\nguilt. Other more complex and social emo -\\ntions including love or other mixed feelings \\nrepresent a much bigger challenge for empir-\\nical study [64].\\n2.1.2.

Many theorists who \\nemphasize this aspect of  empathy believe \\nthat cognitive empathy precedes affective \\nempathy” [60]. \\nCognitive empathy as an ability of  under -\\nstanding other’s feelings is closely related to \\ntheory of  mind  which refers to represent and \\nunderstand the mental state of  others in gen -\\neral [67]. Mental states include beliefs, desires, \\nintentions, as well as emotions and affective \\nstates. So, “mentalizing about affective state \\nof  others can be therefore called emotional \\ntheory of  mind - which is more or less synon -\\nymous with cognitive empathy” [63]. Also, \\ncognitive empathy is often compared with \\nimitation, altruism and moral cognition [68].\\n2.1.3. The integration of affective and \\ncognitive empathy \\nIt is important to point out that during de -\\nvelopment of  the concept of  empathy, the au -\\nthors gave emphasis on different things, and \\nit is only nowdays, after many research, that \\ntheorists see empathy as an inclusive concept, \\nnot only because of  its interdisciplinary na -\\nture, but also due to its affective and cognitive \\ncomponents and all that it conveys. Strayer \\n[69] notes that affective component is the es -\\nsence of  empathy, and the cognitive compo -\\nnent is a process through which that essence \\ncomes into being. Definitions of  empathy \\nwhich includes both cognitive and affective \\ndimension note that “although empathy en -\\ntails an emotional resonance between the em -\\npathizer and the object of  empathy, it also is \\ncharacterized by the maintenance of  a clear \\ncognitive and experiential boundary between \\nthe two, such that the empathizer can always \\ndistinguish between his/her own thoughts \\nand feelings and those of  others” [70]. Some \\ndefinitions of  empathy which includes both \\ncomponents are: “The capacities to resonate \\nwith another person’s emotions, understand \\nhis/her thoughts and feelings, separate our \\nown thoughts and emotions from those of  \\nthe observed and responding with the appro -\\npriate prosocial and helpful behavior” [71]; \\n“The act of  perceiving, understanding, expe -\\nriencing and responding to others emotional \\nstates or ideas” [72]. Non-verbal expressing \\nempathy, encompassing both cognitive and \\naffective component, is thought of  as an ad -\\nvanced form of  empathy [15].\\n2.2. Phenomena related to but distinct from \\nempathy \\nStudies discuss several phenomena which \\nare related to empathy but at the same time \\ndistinct from it. Such phenomena are mimic -\\nry, emotional contagion, sympathy, compas -\\nsion, empathic concern, and empathic pain \\nor personal distress. Mimicry is described as \\nthe tendency to automatically synchronize af -\\nfective facial expressions, vocalizations, body \\npostures, and movements with those of  the \\nother person [73]. It has a role as a low-level \\nmechanism contributing empathy. When an \\nobserver perceive others affective facial ex -\\npressions, such as a smile, or different bodily \\nconcomitants, corresponding affective ex -\\npression or bodily concomitants result in \\nthe observer.

Emotional contagion is tendency to “catch” \\nothers emotions and has been labeled as \\n“primitive empathy” [76]. For example, ba -\\nbies start crying when they hear other babies \\ncrying– long before they develop a sense of  \\nself  separate from others. Emotion conta -\\ngion may function as one core component \\nof  empathy. Neither mimicry nor emotional \\ncontagion are a full experience of  empathy \\nbecause empathy crucially depends upon \\nself-awareness and self-other distinction \\n[76, 74, 54, 63, 75].\\nIn empathy, sympathy, empathic concern, and \\ncompassion, affective changes are induced in \\nthe observer in response to the perceived or \\nimagined affective state of  the other person. \\nHowever, while empathy involves isomor -\\nphic emotions to those of  the other person \\n(empathizing with a sad person will result in \\nsadness in self), sympathy, empathic concern, \\nand compassion do not necessarily involve \\nshared emotions (encounter with sad per -\\nson will result in either pity or compassionate \\nlove and care, but not sadness). In empathy \\nobserver’s emotions reflect affective sharing \\n(“feeling with” the other person) while in \\nsympathy, empathic concern, and compas -\\nsion, observer’s emotions are inherently oth-\\ner-oriented (“feeling for” the other person) \\nwith motivation to help, care and relieve oth-\\ners suffering [77, 74, 78, 54].\\nEmpathy is closely related to pro-social, al -\\ntruistic, and other-oriented motivations . It is con -\\nsidered as a first necessary step in process \\nthat begins with emotional contagion which \\nunderlies affect sharing, followed by under -\\nstanding of  others emotions, which then \\nmotivates other-related feelings such as sym-\\npathy, empathic concern, and compassion, \\nwhich may further promote engagement in \\nprosocial and helping behaviour [77, 54]. \\nEmpathic pain  or personal distress refers to \\nstrong negative affective state and response \\nto others suffering, followed by desire to \\nturn away from the situation in order to pro-\\ntect self  from extremely negative emotions, \\nand consequently feel better. This phenom -\\nenon is more self-centered than other-ori -\\nented [78, 63]. Batson [57] and Eisenberg \\n[79] confirmed that people who feel com-\\npassion and empathy in certain situation \\nhelp more often than the ones who suffer \\nfrom empathic pain or distress. Empathic \\npain or distress results in negative emotions, \\nit is related to withdrawal and disengaging \\nfrom certain relationships, and if  it is ex -\\nperienced chronically, it may have negative \\nhealth outcomes.\\n3. The evolutionary origins of empathy\\nHumans are social beings and their surviv-\\nal depends greatly on their social interactions, \\nforming relationships and mutual connec -\\ntions, as well as accurate social judgements. It \\nis highly unlikely that empathy is a result of  a \\nrandom mutation and emerged without hav -\\ning some kind of  evolutionary development \\nin humans. Throughout evolution, organiza -\\ntion of  neural activities of  the brain evolved, \\nwhich enabled the occurrence of  certain im-\\nportant human behaviours, such as empathy. \\nEmpathy is significant because it plays an \\nimportant role in the survival of  the species, \\nand improves the likelihood of  staying in a \\nsocial group. That is why during evolution \\npeople developed several separate neural sys-\\ntems, combination and cooperation of  which \\nenables complex behavior within social inter-\\nactions, as well as the development of  both \\nemotional and social intelligence.'),\n",

Some forms of  em -\\npathy can be found in animal behavior, espe -\\ncially in primates such as taking care of  the \\noffspring, certain forms of  social intelligence \\nand play, which are considered evolutionary \\npredecessor of  empathy. Taking care of  the \\noffspring is evolutionally extremely impor -\\ntant because of  its contribution to genetic fit-\\nness (kin selection) and it is genetically based. \\nHowever, what is specific to humans is de -\\nvelopment of  prefrontal cortex which led to \\ndevelopment of  self-awareness, other-aware -\\nness, emotion self-regulation, speech abil -\\nity and understanding language, and mutual \\nemotion-sharing through language and con -\\nversation, as well as ability of  reflection and \\nmetacognition – these all being processes and \\nabilities which developed alongside with em -\\npathy, which all leads to prosocial behavior \\nand altruism among humans. That means hu -\\nmans show affection both to their offspring, \\nto other people who are non-kin (because it \\nprovides reproductive advantage), and even \\nfeel empathy toward different species (ani -\\nmals). Besides evolutionary development of  \\nthe cortex, other biological systems vital for \\nempathy evolved: autonomic nervous sys -\\ntems (sympathetic and parasympathetic divi -\\nsion), and endocrine system which both have \\nan important role in our emotions, and for -\\nmation of  relationships and pair-bonding; as \\nwell as limbic system (hypothalamus, hippo -\\ncampus, amygdala, etc.), which has a role in \\nemotion evaluation and regulation. It is obvi -\\nous that evolution of  various neurobiological \\nmechanisms required for empathy occurred, \\nas well as the ones for perception, under -\\nstanding, prediction, and responding to oth -\\ners mental states which are all interconnected \\n[14, 12, 55, 74].\\nAffective empathy in humans probably \\noccurred as a result of  kin selection, recip -\\nrocal altruism and sexual selection, since it \\ninspires altruistic behavior and morality, and \\nalso inhibits violence and aggression, stimu -\\nlates group cohesion, and ingroup-outgroup \\ndistincion. On the other hand, cognitive \\nempathy developed due to increasing social \\ncomplexity in groups, which is conditioned \\nby the advanced reciprocal exchange, cooper -\\nation and the likelihood by being deceived. It \\ninvolves the ability to predict other people’s \\nbehaviour, to maintain conversations, devel -\\nop social expertise, to lie and to realize when \\nsomeone is lying (“cheating detection”) [74].\\nIndicators of  evolutionary development \\nand genetic predisposition of  certain com -\\nponents of  empathy would be explained \\nthrough the development of  humans from \\nbirth, and will be mentioned in reviews of  \\nneuroscience research of  each empathy com -\\nponent. \\n4.

Cogni -\\ntive capacity of  taking others perspective, \\nand 3. Emotion regulation which is regula -\\ntion mechanisms that enable distinguishing \\nself  from the other, and one’s own emotions \\nfrom others. In contemporary neuroscience \\nstudies, especially the ones in which func -\\ntional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI is \\nused, researchers attempted to determine the \\nneural basis of  each component of  empathy \\nenlisted by Decety and Jackson [12, 80], along \\nwith their interconnections, having in mind \\nthe complexity of  the neural process in the \\nbrain during empathy. \\n4.1. Emotion sharing between self and others \\nPerception and action coupling\\nStudying perception of  other people’s be-\\nhaviour is significant as it plays a key role in \\nunderstanding other people’s emotions and \\nintentions. Shortly after birth, a newborn has \\nspontaneous motor reactions and imitation, \\nwhich enables it to communicate with those \\naround, as well as perception and action cou-\\npling [81, 12]. Behavioral manifestation of  \\nempathy can be seen early in child’s develop-\\nment. From as early as 6 months old, an in -\\nfant shows preference of  certain people and \\ncharacters, while at 1.5-2 year-olds a child can \\nmanifest prosocial behavior and affection to \\nthe other person in pain, or even sympathy to \\nsomeone without expressing their emotions \\n[81].\\nPerception-action model, PAM by Preston \\nand de Waal [82] discusses perception and ac-\\ntion coupling between the observer and the \\nobserved. By perception of  others behavior, \\nautomatically activates neural representations \\n(autonomic and somatic response) of  that \\nbehavior in the observer. This includes pre -\\nmotor cortex, parietal cortex, supplementary \\nmotor area, and cerebellum [81, 12, 80, 55, \\n82, 63, 75].\\nThe discovery of  somatosensory neu -\\nrons, so-called “mirror neurons”, provides \\na physiological mechanism for direct link \\nbetween perception and action. Mirror neu -\\nrons were discovered accidentally in ma -\\ncaque monkeys’ ventral premotor cortex in \\n1996 [83]. They were later also found in oth-\\ner brain regions such as frontal intraparietal \\nregion and primary motor cortex, as well as \\nin the emotional centers in the brain. These \\nneurons are called mirror neurons because \\nthey activate in the observer during a spe -\\ncific motor action and perception which are \\nactive in the person experiencing it. In other \\nwords, they reflect automatic transformation \\nof  the other person behavior in correspond-\\ning neural representation in the observer and \\ncreate a functional bridge between first-per -\\nson and third-person information, between \\nself  and the other. This is what happens in \\nempathy, as well as in other similar processes \\nsuch as understanding, imitation, and men -\\ntalizing [81, 84, 85, 63].\\nEmotion sharing\\nStudying emotion sharing among humans \\nis very important in understanding the con -\\ncept of  empathy, especially its affective com-\\nponent. Understanding others’ emotional \\nsignals has an important adaptive function, \\nas well as in the formation and maintenance \\nof  social interactions and relationships. From \\nbirth we express the need to engage in rela -\\ntionships with other people. Newborns ex -\\npress distress and cry whenever they hear \\nother newborns crying.

Like -\\nwise, if  we observe a facial expression of  a \\ncertain emotion, the similar expression is ac -\\ntivated in the observer’s face, as well as the \\nemotion itself. So, mirror neurons are also \\ninvolved in perception of  others emotion. \\nThey are present in somatosensory cortex, \\nanterior frontal gyrus in the right hemisphere, \\nand posterior parietal cortex [77, 81, 86, 63].\\nMany researchers of  empathy are focused \\non studying the observation of  pain in oth -\\ners, in which people are observing pain in the \\nother person or experienced pain themselves. \\nPain expression offers a key signal which \\nmay motivate help-oriented behavior in oth -\\ners, i.e. activate empathy. It has been estab -\\nlished that observing a person who is in pain \\nand suffering is related to neural response \\nwhich processes motivational-affective and \\nsensory dimension of  pain in the observer. \\nA so-called “pain matrix” is activated which \\nincludes dominantly anterior cingulate cor -\\ntex, anterior insula in the right hemisphere, \\nas well as primary and secondary somatosen -\\nsory cortex. Besides, brainstem and cerebel -\\nlum are also activated. Somatosensory cortex \\nis included in sensory-discrimination aspect \\nof  pain, for example body part, intensity of  \\nstimuli etc. Anterior cingulate cortex and an -\\nterior insula are involved in the analysis of  \\naffective-motivational aspect of  pain, such \\nas evaluation of  personal distress. Insula is \\nimportant in representation and integration \\nof  emotional states, while anterior cingulate \\ncortex affects motivational and reaction re -\\nsponse. Brain structures that also participate \\nin the pain matrix are amygdala, hippocam -\\npus, and thalamus [77, 81, 12, 80, 55, 87, 74, \\n84, 86, 54, 85, 63, 75].\\nApart from the pain area, some studies \\nwere done on expressing other emotions \\nsuch as disgust, fear, anxiety, anger, sadness, \\ntouch, reward, social exclusion, and shame, \\nwhere this, aforementioned scientific data \\nwere confirmed [77, 81, 55, 84, 86, 54, 85, \\n63].\\nFinally, shared representations on cortical \\nlevel between self  and the other which are \\nfound in behavior analyzing, pain process -\\ning, emotion recognizing etc., all provide \\nneurophysiological base for understanding \\nempathy which manifests through automatic \\nactivation of  motor or affective cortical rep -\\nresentations. \\n4.2.

ToM refers to \\nhuman metacognitive capacity to explain and \\nunderstand mental state of  the other person, \\nincluding their beliefs, desires, intentions, and \\nemotions [84, 86, 85, 63].\\nThe self-awareness is crucial in appraisal \\nof  the other person’s mental state and emo -\\ntions. This capacity is important in empathy, \\nand in maintaining the distinction between \\nself  and the other, having in mind at all times \\nwhere the emotions come from, i.e., whether \\nthey belong to the other person or to the self. \\nThis includes the capacity for taking others \\nsubjective point of  view through putting self  \\nin their shoes and imagining how that person \\nfeels. \\nThe capacity of  self-awareness and distin-\\nguishing self  from the other person is related \\nwith interaction of  several brain areas, name-\\nly ventromedial prefrontal cortex, medial \\nprefrontal cortex, and inferior parietal cortex \\nin the right hemisphere. Self-awareness is re-\\nlated with medial prefrontal cortex, anterior \\ninsula and secondary somatosensory cortex, \\nwhile other-awareness is related with medi -\\nal prefrontal cortex, frontopolar cortex, and \\nposterior cingulate cortex [81, 12, 80, 55, 63]. \\n4.3. Mental flexibility and self-regulation \\nUnderstanding and experiencing other \\npeople’s emotions does not automatically \\nlead to empathy but must be regulated from \\nwithin, which explains why empathy also in -\\ncludes emotion regulation processes. Em -\\npathy includes perspective taking, and it is \\nan important part of  it. Mental flexibility to \\nadopt someone else’s point of  view is an ef -\\nfortful and controlled process. Children can \\ntake other people’s point of  view and that is \\nwhat sets us apart from other primates and \\nis an integral part of  interpersonal commu -\\nnication. That ability develops gradually. At \\nan age of  1.5 years old, affective component \\nof  empathy is developed – that includes tak-\\ning others perspective and recognizing their \\nemotions. Cognitive component of  empa -\\nthy includes understanding of  others men -\\ntal state, intentions and beliefs, as well as ex -\\necutive functions such as attention, working \\nmemory, inhibition control, and self-regula -\\ntion. These functions mature in adolescence \\n[81, 12].\\nEmotion regulation, which Decety and \\nJackson [12, 80] included in empathy as one \\nof  its components, is defined as the process \\nof  initiating, avoiding, inhibiting, maintain -\\ning, or modulating the occurrence, form, \\nintensity, or duration of  internal emotional \\nstate, emotion-related psychological process-\\nes and goals, and behavioral concomitants \\nof  emotion, in the service of  accomplishing \\none’s goal [88]. Emotion regulation plays an \\nimportant role in regulating one’s own emo -\\ntions so that it is not experienced as aversive, \\nand in order for us to be able to feel positive \\nconcern for the other person. Complete em -\\npathic overflow is not what empathy’s goal is. \\nThat is why emotion regulation is crucial in \\nempathy process, especially in relationships \\nsuch as physician/medical staff-patient, ther-\\napist-client, whereas one side uses empathy to \\nhelp others, but thus makes them vulnerable. \\nDue to this emotional openness and vulner -\\nability, it is possible to become overwhelmed \\nwith emotions, experience personal distress, \\nanxiety, aversive emotional reactions, dis -\\ncomfort, and negative physical excitement. In \\nsuch situation, a person would no longer be \\nable to help others. That being said, empathy \\nneeds regulation – inhibiting and suppress -\\ning of  one’s own sensitivity and emotional \\nresponse to others pain is important in or -\\nder to avoid negative interference.

They are orbitofrontal-ventromedial, and \\ndorsolateral cortex which, in collaboration \\nwith subcortical regions, are involved in me -\\ndiating various processes. Orbitofrontal part \\nis in charge of  emotion regulation. Ventro -\\nmedial prefrontal cortex along with other re -\\ngions takes part in emotion regulation (amyg -\\ndala), memory (hippocampus), and executive \\nfunctions (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). \\nVentromedial region is a crucial component \\nin the neural network of  empathy. Anterior \\ncingulate cortex participates in regulating \\nboth cognitive and affective processes. Neu -\\nral mechanisms which regulate social percep -\\ntion and emotional processing are also im -\\nportant in understanding empathy, namely \\nlateral and medial prefrontal cortex, medial \\norbitofrontal cortex, and the amygdala [81, \\n12, 80, 55].\\n4.4. Empathy model: “bottom-up” emotion \\nsharing processes and “top-down” emotion \\nregulation and flexibility processes\\nDecety and Lamm [55] defined empa -\\nthy through three components with their \\nneural processes, and suggested a model in \\nwhich empathy consists of  two processes: \\nfirst, bottom-up processes of  direct emo -\\ntion sharing which are automatically acti -\\nvated, and second, top-down processes of  \\nregulation through contextual and cognitive \\nappraisal, emotion control and regulation \\nwhich lead to response flexibility making the \\nperson less dependent on external cues. This \\ndual process describes the process of  empa -\\nthy through occurrence and development of  \\nneurophysiological processes in the person’s \\nbody. Top-down processes are crucial, as they \\nrepresent metacognitive feedback loop which \\ndecides whether the person reacts to others’ \\nemotional state or not. Cognitive appraisal is \\ntherefore even more important in empathy \\nthan emotional stimuli, because it may either \\ninhibit a response to others emotional state \\nor lead to an empathic response [55, 54, 85].\\nAnother model similar to this one was \\nsuggested by Watt [75], and it describes the \\ncreation of  empathy through four processes: \\nfirst, there are the receptive processing com -\\nponents involved in appraisal and recognition \\nof  emotional states which includes facial ex -\\npression, tones of  voice and body kinetics. \\nThen, this information reaches “global gate” \\nthat controls the relative activation of  em -\\npathic state.

Besides, it plays a role in \\na complex social cognition and behavior in -\\ncluding pair bonding, attachment, trust, gen -\\nerosity, empathy, empathic concern, empathic \\naccuracy, fear and aggression, as well as per -\\nception of  our and others emotional states, \\nperceived social connectedness and support \\nor social-evaluated threat. It can be viewed as \\nbiological sensitivity to social context. Stud -\\nies show that oxytocin increase empathy and \\nprosocial behavior [81, 63]. Vasopressin is \\nrelated to many forms of  social behaviours, \\nincluding protective aggression, anxiety, pair \\nbonding in a man, social communication and \\nrecognition, as well as perception of  emo -\\ntional faces or situations in man. It increases \\naffiliate behavior in women [74]. Opioids also \\nhave significant role in social behavior and \\nattachment. Endogene opioids are released \\nduring social contact and this cause reward -\\ning feeling of  attachment. On the contrary, \\nexogenous opioids have the opposite effect, \\nin reducing the need for attachment. Patients \\nwith opioid addiction show reduced empath-\\nic concern. Studies also discuss potential role \\nof  other neurotransmitters such as dopamine \\nand serotonin in mediating our ability to so -\\ncial cognition, which means they are also re -\\nlated to empathy [74]. It seems that variety of  \\nneurochemical compounds participate in the \\nformation and modulation of  empathy.\\nMany twin studies, genetic association \\nstudies and imaging genetics have shown the \\nevidence for genetic contribution explain -\\ning individual differences in empathy. Meta-\\nanalysis has shown genetic factors accounted \\nfor 35% of  the variance of  empathy in gen-\\neral. Researchers also isolated specific genes \\nwhich are contributing to heritability of  em-\\npathy [74, 63, 75]. Certain metabolic states \\nreduce empathic response, such as hunger, \\nfatigue, sleep deprivation, and pain [75].\\n5.2. Contextual and personality factors \\nmodulating empathy \\nDifferent contextual factors, personality \\ntraits of  the observed person and social be -\\nhavior affect the observer’s formation of  em-\\npathic response. Familiarity and relatedness as \\nwell as competition and envy play an impor -\\ntant role in empathy. Factors that were found \\nin research to be positive related to empathy \\nare: positive relationship between observer \\nand the other person, level of  mutual close -\\nness (siblings, caregivers, best friends) and \\nsimilarity (personal attributes, biological and \\nsocial background), belonging to the same \\ngroup (sports team, race, religion), assess -\\nment of  others fair play (variety of  games), \\nassessment of  others helplessness, assess -\\nment of  others emotional state (aggression \\nand negative emotions of  the other person \\ninhibit the observer’s empathy in opposite to \\npain and suffering), social comparison (evalu-\\nation of  others social status, resources, suc -\\ncess) [77, 74, 78, 54, 75]. \\n5.3.

Measuring empathy \\nThe measurement of  empathy is a seri -\\nous challenge for researchers in many dis -\\nciplines from social psychology, individual \\ndifferences, and clinical psychology. Part of  \\nthis challenge is due to the lack of  a clear, \\nuniversal definition for empathy. However, \\ncontemporary definitions are more complex \\nand highlight a range of  cognitive, affective, \\nand physiological processes. From 1940s un -\\ntil today, researches used various approaches \\nto measure empathy [89]. Empathy research \\npioneers, Cottrell and Dymond [90], proved \\nthat it was possible to develop a quantitative \\nindex of  empathic ability. Reliability and va -\\nlidity of  the measure presented by them could \\nnot be viewed as the final results, but it was \\ngood enough to claim that the improvement \\nof  their measure or similar one would lead to \\nvalid and reliable empathy measure [90]. \\nEmpathy measures were significantly in -\\nfluenced by cognitive approach due to cogni-\\ntive psychology’s popularity throughout 20 th \\ncentury ( Diplomacy Test of  Empathic Ability  \\n[91]; Empathy Scale [91]), even though impor -\\ntant measures were also emotion-based ( Emo-\\ntional Empathic Tendency ; [92]). In 1980s and \\n1990s, social and developmental psychology \\nemphasized the multidimensionality of  the \\nempathy emphasizing physiologically linked \\naffective states [93], cognitive processing, or \\na self-awareness of  these feelings [93], and \\nemotion regulation [94, 95]. Since 1990s, em -\\npathy measures have been influenced by the \\ndevelopment of  socio-cognitive neurosci -\\nence, although self-report approaches have \\ncontinued to be developed and extensively \\nused [89].\\nHall and Schwartz [47] found that 78% \\nof  393 empathy-related scientific studies \\npublished between 2001 and 2013 used one \\nor more empathy measures: 80% of  the in -\\nstruments measured self-reported empathy, \\n12% measured empathy rated by someone \\nelse, and 7% measured rating of  someone \\nelse’s empathy. Total sum included 72 used \\nmeasures. Most common measured aspects \\nof  empathy were: perspective taking (22%), \\nfantasy (15%), empathic concern (30%), and \\npersonal distress (12%).\\nThere is the great diversity in approaches \\nto measuring empathy which reflect the high-\\nly complex and multifaceted nature of  em -\\npathy. Measures can be grouped into three \\nmajor categories: 1. Self-report instruments, \\n2. Behavioral observational methods, and 3. \\nNeuroscientific approaches [89]. \\nFirst category of  empathy measures, \\nsubjective self-report measures of  empathy \\ncurrently provide the most comprehensive \\nmeasures to date and are most common in \\nscientific studies.

For the purposes of  this pa-\\nper we shall present four scales: one of  the \\nfirst self-report empathy measure, Hogan’s \\nEmpathy Scale [9]; two most commonly used \\nmeasures, Interpersonal Reactivity Index , and \\nEmpathy Quotient  [47], as well as E-Question-\\nnaire: Emotional Empathy Scale and Fantasy Scale \\n[60] which is an example of  self-report em -\\npathy measure developed in Croatia. There \\nare other self-report empathy measures that \\nare also important: Balanced Emotional Empa -\\nthy Scale [96], Multidimensional Emotional Empa-\\nthy Scale [97], Feeling and Thinking Scale [98], Ba-\\nsic Empathy Scale [99], Griffith Empathy Measure \\n[100], Toronto Empathy Questionnaire [101] and \\nQuestionnaire of  Cognitive and Affective Empathy  \\n[102], which are also widely used [47].\\nEmpathy Scale\\nHogan’s Empathy Scale, HES [9] is histori-\\ncally very important measure as a one of  the \\nfirst self-report empathy measure and as an \\nempirically keyed empathy scale. Hogan con-\\nstructed Empathy Scale within framework of  \\nmultidimensional theory of  moral develop -\\nment. He has suggested that moral develop -\\nment can be conceptualized and moral con -\\nduct explained in terms of  five dimensions \\n(moral knowledge, socialization, empathy, au-\\ntonomy, and a dimension of  moral judgment), \\neach defined by a separate measure [103, 104]. \\nEmpathy, seen as an everyday manifestation \\nof  the disposition to adopt a broad moral per-\\nspective, to take “the moral point of  view,” \\nalso becomes important within the context to \\nresearch in moral development [9]. HES may \\nbe considered as a more cognitive measure of  \\nempathy developed from the definition that \\nempathy is “the intellectual or imaginative ap-\\nprehension of  another’s condition or state of  \\nmind without actually experiencing that per -\\nson’s feelings” [9].\\nThe empathy scale was developed by the \\nstandard technique of  an items analysis the \\nresponses of  high-rated versus low-rated \\ngroups, and were compared with 957 true-\\nfalse items in the California Psychological \\nInventory (CPI), the Minnesota Multiphasic \\nPersonality Inventory (MMPI), and a Univer-\\nsity of  California’s Institute of  Personality As-\\nsessment and Research (IPAR) pool of  items. \\nFrom these analyses, 64 items (32 scored true, \\n32 false) were selected for the final scale, of  \\nwhich 31 items are taken from CPI, 25 from \\nMMPI, and the remaining 8 from various ex-\\nperimental studies of  IPAR [9].\\nHES sample items: As a rule I have little dif-\\nficult time putting myself  into other people’s shoes; I \\nhave seen some things so sad that I almost felt like \\ncrying; I have a pretty clear idea of  what I would \\ntry to impart to my students if  I were a teacher ; I \\nfrequently undertake more than I can accomplish [9]. \\nAccording to Hogan [9], empathy is predica-\\ntive of  low anxiety, self-acceptance, lack of  \\nauthoritarian tendencies, and extroversion. \\nJohnson, Cheek and Smither [105] listed vari-\\nous studies by other authors, and claim that \\nHogan’s Empathy Scale is a reliable empathy \\nmeasure. In correlation with other measures \\nand by psychometric analysis, they conclude \\nthat Empathy Scale can be defined by four \\nscales: Social Self-Confidence, Even Tem-\\nperedness, Sensitivity, and Non-conformity. \\nHowever, same authors argued questionable \\npsychometric properties of  Hogan’s scale \\nbased on their own research. \\nInterpersonal reactivity index\\nDavis’ Interpersonal reactivity index , IRI \\n[105], though constructed in 1980, is by far \\nthe most widely and frequently used empa -\\nthy measure until today [47]. Its popularity \\nis attributable to several desirable qualities.'),\n",

Second, the IRI is regarded as the \\nmost comprehensive measure of  self-report -\\ned empathic dispositions. Finally, this scale is \\nrelatively short and thus simple to administer \\n[106].\\nThe IRI consist of  38 items and four \\nscales, each measuring a distinct component \\nof  empathy: perspective taking (PT), empath -\\nic concern (EC), fantasy (FS), and personal \\ndistress (PD). The PT scale measures the \\nprocess of  role taking, the tendency to adopt \\nthe psychological points of  view of  others. \\nPT sample items: I believe that there are two sides \\nto every question and try to look at them both; Before \\ncriticizing somebody, I try to imagine how I would feel \\nif  I were in their place. The EC scale measures \\nthe affective outcomes, the tendency to ex -\\nperience other-oriented feelings and the re -\\nsponse to distress in others with the reactive \\nresponse of  sympathy and compassion.  EC \\nsample items: I am often quite touched by things \\nthat I see happen; When I see someone being taken \\nadvantage of, I feel kind of  protective toward them). \\nThe FS scale measures the tendency to trans -\\npose oneself  into feelings and actions of  fic-\\ntitious characters. FS sample items: When I am \\nreading an interesting story or novel, I imagine how \\nI would feel if  the events in the story were happening \\nto me; When I watch a good movie, I can very easily \\nput myself  in the place of  a leading character . The \\nPD scale demonstrates an affective outcome, \\nand is designed to tap ones’ own feelings of  \\npersonal unease and discomfort in reaction \\nto the emotions of  others. PD sample items: \\nI sometimes feel helpless when I am in the middle \\nof  a very emotional situation; I tend to lose control \\nduring emergencies [107, 105, 108]. The PD, EC \\nand FS scales assess affective components of  \\nempathy, whereas the PT scale represents the \\ncognitive component.\\nA number of  studies have shown that \\nthe IRI provides a reliable and valid way of  \\nmeasuring people’s empathic tendencies via \\nself-report [108]. However, there is still some \\nneed to further investigate certain validity is -\\nsues.\\nEmpathy Quotient\\nEmpathy quotient, EQ created by Baron-\\nCohen and Wheelwright [66] is the second \\nmost commonly used measure in the period \\nbetween 2001 and 2013 [47]. Authors de -\\nfined empathy as ‘”the drive to identify an -\\nother person’s emotions and thoughts, and to \\nrespond to these with an appropriate emo -\\ntion” [66]. EQ was designed to be a short, \\neasy to use scale that measures both cogni -\\ntive and affective components of  empathy. \\nIt contains 40 empathy items and 20 control \\nitems included to provide some distraction \\nand to minimize the focus on empathy. Em -\\npathy sample items: I can easily tell if  someone \\nelse wants to enter a conversation; I find it difficult \\nto explain to others things that I understand easily, \\nwhen they don’t understand it first time; Friendships \\nand relationships are just too difficult; I really enjoy \\ncaring for other people . Control sample items: I \\ndream most nights; I am at my best first thing in the \\nmorning; I would never break a law, no matter how \\nminor; I would be too nervous to go on a big roller -\\ncoaster [66]. \\nE-questionnaire\\nE-questionnaire was created by Raboteg-\\nŠarić [60]. The author was aware of  the com-\\nplexity of  the empathy concept, and con -\\nducted a study in which was constructed a \\nnew empathy measure that is appropriate for \\nadolescents and context of  our country.

It consists \\nof  19 items which measure global affective \\nempathy reaction. Affective empathy sample \\nitems: I get sad when I see helpless people; I feel bad \\nif  I have to be the bearer of  bad news. Fantasy \\nscale measures ability to imagine emotions \\nand actions of  characters in stories, novels, \\nand movies. Fantasy sample items: When I am \\nwatching a movie, I imagine being one of  the char-\\nacters on screen; When I am watching a good movie, \\nI am so taken in that I do not see or hear anything \\naround me [60].\\nIn the second category of  empathy mea -\\nsures are behavioral observational methods \\nsuch as Picture Viewing Paradigms  [109], Com-\\nic Strip Task  [110], Picture Stories  [111], and \\nKids Empathetic Development Scale  [112]. These \\nmethods include evaluations of  experimental \\nstimuli and performance on tests. For exam -\\nple, participants are watching images (static \\nimages or video clips) depicting individuals \\nwho are in certain situations, often negative \\n(confinement, injury, grief), but they may also \\nbe positive, and make a rating response to \\nwhat degree are able to imagine feeling and \\nexperiencing what the other one is experienc-\\ning; participants are given a series of  comic \\nstrips and have to choose the best one out \\nof  two or three strips on an answer card to \\nfinish the story; participants have to interpret \\nvisual scenes (aversive and neutral) in color \\npictures, and predict the most likely behav -\\nioral consequence based on cognitive or af -\\nfective cues [89]. \\nThe third category of  empathy measures is \\na neuroscientific approach to empathy which \\nincludes various medical techniques used in \\nneuroscience studies, such as brain imag -\\ning techniques (fMRI) and other measures \\nof  central nervous system activity (electro -\\nencephalography, EEG), measure of  facial \\nelectromyography (EMG), and autonomic \\nnervous system measures (skin conductance, \\nheart rate), which are all used to confirm neu-\\nral correlates and basis of  empathy. Neuro -\\nscienfitic measures are highly important for \\nfuture research of  empathy [89]. \\nThe great diversity in approaches to mea -\\nsuring empathy could mean that researchers \\nhave yet to find an adequately reliable and \\nvalid measure of  empathy, there is highly \\ncomplex and multifaceted nature of  empathy, \\nand what empathy is and how it should be \\nmeasured is different from situation to situa-\\ntion or population to population. Uncertain -\\nty remains as to whether empathy should be \\nmeasured as a one-dimensional or a multidi -\\nmensional construct measuring one or more \\ncomponents. Some limitations of  self-report \\nmeasures are subjectivity and susceptibility to \\nmotivational distortion, response bias (social \\ndesirability of  empathy), and that each mea -\\nsure has been based on a different definition \\nof  empathy.

Empathy is one of  the \\nprimary skills for interpersonal communica -\\ntion and relationships, and like other skills, \\ncan develop in various ways and be trained. It \\ncan be taught through good examples of  em -\\npathic behavior in key figures during child -\\nhood, in education, initiation in society, etc. \\nIt is important to encourage the development \\nof  empathic skills because empathic person \\npositively affects both others’ and their own \\npsychological-physical-social health. \\nMany studies  discuss the possibility of  \\nlearning and developing empathy ability \\nthrough training or enhancement programs. \\nResearchers have attempted to teach individ -\\nuals the meaning of  empathy, to recognize \\nemotions in others, to take the perspective \\nof  others, and to show empathy in various \\nsocial situations. Many empathy training pro -\\ngram studies have tried to increase empathy \\nlevels in different helping professions such as \\nphysicians, therapists, medical students, and \\nnurses. A popular area for empathy training \\nis for children and adolescents, and also for \\npsychiatric patients and criminal offenders \\n[113]. Empathy training is very useful in ed -\\nucational context for children and teachers, \\nit can increase tolerance, academic achieve -\\nment, emotional intelligence, and pro-social \\nbehavior, improve communication skills, and \\non the other hand, it can decrease problems \\nof  social prejudice and aggression among \\nchildren [27]. When it comes to health, em -\\npathic communication skills are associated \\nwith increased patient satisfaction, improved \\nadherence to therapy, decreased medical er -\\nrors, fewer malpractice claims, better health \\noutcomes, decreased burn-out and increased \\nphysical wellbeing [114]. \\nThree types of  empathy could be targeted \\nin training: cognitive, affective, and behav -\\nioral. Empathy training programs employ a \\nnumber of  methods included experiential \\ntraining (instructors provide “experiences” \\nsuch as games and role-play), didactic (lec -\\nture based), skills training (lectures, demon -\\nstrations, and practice), and mixed methods. \\nMany of  these correspond to methods found \\nin behavioral skills training, which includes \\nmodeling, instructions, rehearsal, and feed -\\nback. Some reviews of  interpersonal skills \\ntraining, including empathy training, have \\nsuggested a training length of  1–3 days [113].\\nTraining methods can be classified into \\nseven types: 1. experiential training - empha -\\nsizes gaining experience on the part of  the \\ntrainees to be a critical factor in meaningful \\nlearning. The instructors are facilitators who \\ndesign experiences for trainees; 2. didactic and \\nexperiential training - the facilitator lectures \\non theory and concepts and then provides ex -\\nperiences for the participants through games, \\ninternships, live cases, problem solving, and \\nso on; 3. skill training - consists of  three com -\\nponents: provide trainees with a description \\nof  well-defined skills to be learned, demon-\\nstrate the effective use of  these skills through \\nmodeling, and provide practice opportunities \\nusing these skills; 4. didactic and skill train -\\ning; 5. mindfulness training - involves teach -\\ning trainees to become mindful, i.e., to be in \\na state of  non-judgmental awareness ground -\\ned in the present moment; 6. video stimulus \\ntraining - the trainer asks the participants to \\nwatch a videotape about others’ empathic be -\\nhaviors, or their own, in mock situations, and \\nto respond to the videotaped excerpts during \\nthe viewing or afterwards. The training ses -\\nsion could also be followed by discussion and \\nfeedback, and 7. writing training - a training \\nmethod that entails asking trainees to write \\nfrom the other’s point of  view or perspective \\n[115].

In nonprofessionals, research results \\nhave indicated that high levels of  empathy \\nare associated with enhanced personal rela -\\ntionships [122] and prosocial behavior [123]. \\nConversely, studies have shown that a lack \\nof  empathy is associated with negative out -\\ncomes, including aggressive behavior such as \\nbullying and sexual offending [124, 99, 125].\\nChiu Ming Lam, Kolomitro and Alam -\\nparambil [115] using narrative review meth -\\nod analyzed 26 quantitative and 3 qualitative \\nstudies of  empathy training.

In \\nsituations like that, motivation for empathic \\nactions may be seduction, fraud, manipula -\\ntion, or wild tendencies, called “ tactical empa-\\nthy” [130]. \\nUsing the term “ spotlight vision”,  Prinz \\n[131] and Bloom [127] describes empathy \\nas a means of  focusing attention for a short \\ntime on an individual fate while neglecting the \\nlarger picture, long-term solutions, and large \\nnumbers of  people. Spotlight effect of  em -\\npathy explains how empathy can be a power -\\nful trigger of  behaviour since it draws one’s \\nawareness to one scene or person. However, \\nit also explains how empathy can be manipu -\\nlated. People are willing to donate time and \\nmoney to one hungry child but not be moved \\nby the fate of  thousands suffering from fam -\\nine or war.\\nThe “ polarizing effect of  empathy” is connect -\\ned to the previous point. In general, when \\nsomeone is empathizing with others, he can \\nagree with their opinions, share their emo -\\ntions, and adopt their viewpoints. In situa -\\ntions of  conflict, one may support the side \\nhe have felt empathy for, while neglecting the \\nother side. If  the empathizer adopts some \\nof  the preferences of  the person of  his em -\\npathy, it is likely that aversions towards the \\nother side are also adopted. These can lead \\nto people committing aggressive acts against \\nthe other side of  a conflict and of  side-taking \\nand empathy can help to revise understand -\\nings of  some hateful acts [64]. \\nAn empathic person can draw out many \\npositive effects for themselves while being \\nempathetic toward someone who is suffering \\nand it can be seen as “ selfish empathy”. It can \\narouse positive emotions which play a strong \\nrole in life satisfaction, it can enriches one’s \\nrange of  experience by expanding the per -\\nception of  a person beyond his or her own \\nsenses and immediate situations, it  allows \\npeople to participate in the lives of  others or \\nsituations other than their current situation. \\nHowever, current researchers do not have a \\nclear picture on all mechanisms of  that type \\nof  empathy so far [64]. \\nOne of  the forms of  the selfishness of  \\nempathy is so-called “ empathic vampirism” , \\nthrough which other person becomes a me -\\ndium of  one’s own experience. The empa -\\nthizer feels and experiences the world vicari -\\nously via others and thereby participates in \\ntheir fate, without, however, having their best \\ninterests in mind. It consists of  the process \\nof  sharing another’s experience and making it \\none’s own over time, without concern for the \\nother’s long-term welfare as an independent \\nbeing. The force of  this definition lies in the \\nidea of  making it your own , of  appropriating \\nit. Stalkers, fans, stage parents, and helicop -\\nter parents fall under this definition of  using \\nothers as medium of  their experience [64]. \\nOne of  the prime examples for this phenom -\\nenon is “ helicopter parenting”, in which parents’ \\ninterest lies in experiencing a perfect youth \\nretrospectively via their children – more per-\\nfect, at least, than their own [132]. \\n“Empathic sadism” or “empathic cruelty” is an -\\nother form of  selfish empathy which in its \\nbasic form, means that an empathic observ -'),\n",

The negative feelings of  other are \\ntranslated by the empathizer into their posi -\\ntive ones. It can appear in a variety of  forms \\nsuch as enjoyment of  tragedies and sad mov-\\nies [134], as a motivation for punishment \\n[133], in sadistic acts, in schadenfreude, and in \\neveryday behaviours like bullying, shaming, \\nand teasing. Sadistic empathy often includes \\nthe manipulation of  others and can be un -\\nderstood as bringing about a situation for the \\nother with the goal of  making their emotion-\\nal response to that situation intelligible, and \\ntherefore possible to share. Psychopaths fall \\ninto the description of  sadistic empathy [64].\\nSituations of  humanitarian aid extend sup-\\nport to help other people beyond the simple \\nborders of  one’s life, and empathy is the mo-\\ntivator for this behavior, as well as morality or \\nreligion, but also identification with the (real \\nor imaginary) helper. It is called “humanitarian \\nempathy - filtered empathy”  [64]. It is a process \\nin which the observer in humanitarian aids \\nidentifies with the helpers, believing they are \\ndoing something heroic, and getting a sense \\nof  pleasure in “helping”, while they are mere-\\nly a bystander, inactive in the pro-social be -\\nhavior [135].\\nTaking into consideration the other side \\nof  empathy gives us possibility to expand our \\nview on complexity and importance of  the \\nphenomena, and a motivation for developing \\nfurther research in this area.\\n9. Future empirical issues\\nIn this final section of  the paper, it’s im-\\nportant to highlight domains and questions \\nwhich should be the focus of  future research \\nefforts. Some authors gave a detailed analy -\\nsis of  empathy research, and they critically \\nreviewed used methodology. They suggest -\\ned some improvements in methodology of  \\nresearch which they find necessary due to \\ncomplexity of  the process of  empathy that \\nincludes parallel and mutually intertwined \\npsychological and biological processes. These \\nprocesses do not need to be separately stud -\\nied as it happened to be the case in some of  \\nthe studies. Some of  the suggestions regard-\\ning further research are analysis of  empathy \\nin more natural environment (less artificial \\nand less controlled than the ones in scientific \\nresearch so far, but compliant with scientific \\nmethodology), development of  better mod -\\nels of  correlation between neurological and \\nbehavioral data [84, 136]. \\nIt is very important to identify and analyze \\nmore precisely and systematically the variety \\nof  cultural frameworks, social situations, and \\npolitical-economic conditions which either \\nsuppress and inhibit basic empathy or am -\\nplify it. Also, the basic definitions of  empa-\\nthy are relatively imprecise and arbitrary, and \\nlikely biased towards forms of  empathy as \\nexpressed in European and North American \\ncontexts [70]. There are some problematic \\nnature of  conceptual and operational defini-\\ntions in scientific studies, and therefore sug-\\ngested that empathy be studied as an abil -\\nity. It is important distinguishing one’s own \\nfeelings from those of  others, investigating \\nhow the different “empathies” relate to each \\nother, distinguishing systematically between \\nverbal and nonverbal empathy, establishing \\ncommon categorizations and definitions, etc. \\n[47]. \\nDue to complexity of  empathy and its \\nmultidisciplinary field of  study it is important \\nin future study to give an integrative func -\\ntional model of  empathy and more careful \\nconceptualization of  the phenomenon. It is \\nalso important to further explore gender dif -\\nferences in empathy, and differences between'),\n",

One of  the special interest is understand -\\ning what motivates people to feel empathy \\nand caring for the other because it is not au -\\ntomatically triggered, how empathy is linked \\nto prosocial behavior, is it a trait or situation-\\nspecific state variable, and analysis of  empa-\\nthy in positive emotions (joy, pride, elation). \\nInsights into plasticity of  the brain networks \\nunderlying empathy can be gained from fur -\\nther clinical and neuroscience research. Very \\nimportant question is how we can train peo -\\nple to be more empathic and which process -\\ning level (bottom-up or top-down) should be \\ntargeted and at what age should the training \\ntake place. It is necessary to have large-scale \\nlongitudinal studies which could have enor -\\nmous implications for education and society \\nas a whole [77, 12, 54]. \\nConclusion\\nEmpathy is the basis of  successful inter -\\npersonal relationships, and it is an ability of  \\nestablishing an acknowledging, stimulating, \\ninspiring and flexible relationship with an -\\nother person, while at the same time the em -\\npathic person contributes to their own wel -\\nfare. The concept of  empathy has developed \\nthrough the past century, along with disci -\\nplines such as psychology, philosophy, medi -\\ncine, and neuroscience, which makes it very \\nsignificant for the welfare of  both individu-\\nals and society. Different studies pointed out \\ndifferent concepts of  empathy and its defi-\\nnition, either affective or cognitive empathy, \\nbut integrating both components is crucial \\nfor understanding empathy as a whole. Some \\nuncertainties are still present in understand -\\ning of  the phenomenon, and empathy over -\\nlaps with some aspects of  other similar phe -\\nnomena like emotional contagion, sympathy \\nand compassion. Developing positive atti -\\ntude toward empathy and through its training \\nit can contribute to healthier interpersonal re -\\nlationships and increase prosocial behavior in \\nsociety, while its negative aspects should be \\nobserved in certain context. Further research \\nin the field of  empathy as one of  the most \\nvital and flexible human ability will continue \\nto explore and develop in greater detail this \\nvery important phenomenon. \\nAcknowledgement\\nNone\\nConflict of Interest\\nNone to declare\\nReferences\\n1.

Većina njih se slaže u značaju koje ima empatija i njezinim pozitivnim \\nutjecajima na međuljudske odnose, iako postoje i neki negativni aspekti empatije. Sa psihološkog i biološkog \\nstanovišta, empatija je neophodna za ljudsko preživljavanje i uspješan život u društvenim grupama. Ovaj rad \\npredstavlja pregled empatije, uključujući povijest koncepta počevši s pojmom Einfühlung, kao i početke pro-\\nučavanja i definiranja empatije, suvremeni pristup, komponente empatije i njezinu evolucijsku i neuroznan-\\nstvenu pozadinu, mjerenje empatije, razvoj empatije kroz trening, i konačno, drugu stranu ovog uglavnom \\npozitivnog koncepta s obzirom na međuljudske odnose. Također smo naveli pregled prijedloga za daljnja \\nistraživanja na ovom području.\\nKljučne riječi: empatija, afektivna empatija, kognitivna empatija, društveno-kognitivna neuroznanost, mjere-\\nnje empatije, trening empatije, sebična empatija'),\n",

You are cooking \\ndinner and, at the same time, trying to get your overtired five-\\nyear-old to put on his pyjamas. The phone rings. It could be \\nyour mother or your squash partner. But in all probability it is \\nsomebody trying to sell you something. You pick up the phone. \\n‘Hello, is that Mrs____ ?’ Your name is mispronounced. You \\nwere right. Telesales. You interrupt their pitch, telling them \\nyou’re not interested before you even know what they’re calling \\nabout. They ask for just a few minutes of your time. You \\nrespond, impatiently, that you’re busy cooking and that you’re \\nnot interested. And just as they begin an apology, you hang up. \\n Being abrupt or rude to telesales people is quite normal. One \\nof the gentlest, most thoughtful people I know usually responds \\nwith irritation, ‘Could you please give me your  phone number so \\nI can phone you  during your  dinner?’ \\n I rarely feel annoyed or impatient when my evenings are \\ninterrupted by a sales call from a stranger in Dublin or Dacca. \\nBut this is not because I am a saint. It is because I’ve worked in \\ntelesales myself and I know what it is like. \\n When I left university my first job was working in the \\nkitchen of a barbeque chicken and sandwich shop in Sydney. \\nAfter an exhausting twelve-hour shift with only fifteen minutes \\nfor lunch, I was sacked at the end of my first day for not putting \\nthe chickens on the skewers straight and peeling potatoes too \\nslowly. My second job, and my third, fourth and fifth, were in \\ntelesales. I began selling a children’s encyclopaedia, then moved \\non to laser printer toner, a taxation journal and, finally, \\nphotocopying machines. \\n I hated it. Every day, around an hour before work started, I \\nbegan feeling sick in my stomach. In the office we were handed \\npages ripped from phone books and ordered to dial. The duty \\nmanager paced around, listening in to our conversations, \\ngesturing to us to ‘close’ the sale, or shouting at us to get back'),\n",

And, of course, almost every person \\nI called wanted to get off the phone immediately. I could hear \\nthe annoyance in their voices. Most nights we were subject to \\nserious verbal abuse at some point. I didn’t feel I could leave: I \\nneeded the money and telesales paid better than a factory job or \\nworking as a shop assistant. \\n This is an experience I have never forgotten. Now, when I \\npick up the phone and realise it is a sales call, I picture the caller \\nsitting in a cubicle with my first duty manager glaring \\naggressively over their shoulder. I know that they are only doing \\nit for the money, and that they would rather be visiting their \\nsister and her new baby or studying for a Masters degree in \\nengineering systems. But they feel they have no choice. They \\nneed the job.  \\n So my approach is to be as polite and engaging as possible. I \\nnearly always tell them that I know what their job is like because \\nI’ve done it too and I wish them well with the rest of their calls. \\nSometimes I get into conversation with them about where they \\nare calling from, their passions, what they would like to do with \\ntheir lives. I ask their name and tell them mine. I almost never \\nwant to buy what they are selling, but I try to treat them as a \\nhuman being and make a personal connection, to bridge our \\nfaceless divide.  \\n \\nThe age of outrospection \\n \\nMost books or courses on the art of living focus on how we can \\ndiscover ways of improving our own lives. The emphasis is, \\nunashamedly, on what can be done to help me .

Each of us \\ncomes for a short visit, not knowing why, yet sometimes \\nseeming to divine a purpose. From the standpoint of daily life, \\nhowever, there is one thing we do know: that man is here for \\nthe sake of other men.’ We will always feel something missing if \\nwe attempt to live alone, hermetically sealed in an isolation of \\nour own making, thinking only of our own pleasures and pains. \\nThe mystery of existence is constituted by our relations with \\neach other.  \\n The twentieth century was an age of intro spection, when \\npsychoanalysis impelled us to search for who we are by looking \\ninside our own heads. But the art of living involves escaping \\nfrom the prison of our own feelings and desires, and embracing \\nthe lives of others. The twenty-first century should be the age of \\noutro spection, where we discover ourselves by learning about \\nother people, and finding out how they live, think and look at \\nthe world.  \\n Empathy is at the heart of how to live and what to do, and is \\nthe ultimate art form for the age of outrospection. \\n \\nEmpathy: an emotional connection \\nor an imaginative leap? \\n \\nWhat exactly is empathy? The concept was invented over a \\ncentury ago by German psychologists and now has two main \\nmeanings. The traditional approach is to think about empathy as \\nan emotional connection between individuals. A different \\napproach, and the one I consider essential for the art of living, is \\nempathy as an imaginative leap in which you endeavour to \\nunderstand the world from the perspective of another person. \\n If you open a psychology textbook you will usually \\nencounter the first approach, in which empathy is defined as the'),\n",

That \\nis, being able to feel what another person feels, such as when \\nyou feel anguish upon seeing the tearful anguish on the face of a \\nchild. Every time you wince when you see someone in pain, you \\nare displaying empathy. This sharing of experience is different \\nfrom sympathy, when your response does not mirror theirs, for \\ninstance feeling pity for someone who is feeling bereft after the \\ndeath of a family member. \\n Empathy of this kind is usually considered an innate \\ncharacteristic over which we have little control, a product of our \\nnatures that competes, often uncomfortably, with our selfish \\ninner drives, aggressiveness and capacity for cruelty. In recent \\ndecades social psychologists and evolutionary biologists have \\nhighlighted this previously neglected aspect of our beings and \\nsocial relations. They argue that it is just as natural for us to feel \\nthe pains and joys of others, and to suffer or enjoy with them, as \\nit is for us to be preoccupied with our self interest. We all have \\nthis capacity to empathise although it may be more developed in \\nsome groups than others, such as in women more than men (a \\ndisputed finding), or amongst family members more than \\nbetween strangers.  \\n Neuroscientists have conducted experiments revealing how \\nour empathic feelings for others are distinct from our feelings \\nabout ourselves.

They may have different tastes.’ If I like \\nchicken soup, it may not be the case that you do too. \\n If we are to take empathy seriously, we should instead place \\nour effort in attempting to imagine the perspective, the desires, \\nthe hopes and beliefs of the other person. This is the essence of \\nperhaps the most famous statement on the art of empathising, \\nwhich was made by Mahatma Gandhi. I remember feeling a \\nshiver run up my spine when I first read this quote, as if I had \\nsuddenly been given access to the truth about being human: ‘I \\nwill give you a talisman. Whenever you are in doubt, or when \\nthe self becomes too much with you, apply the following test. \\nRecall the face of the poorest and the weakest man whom you \\nmay have seen, and ask yourself, if the step you contemplate is \\ngoing to be of any use to him. Will he gain anything by it? Will it \\nrestore him to a control over his own life and destiny?

For a start it \\nis a moral framework that each of us can follow: to consider the \\nperspective of the most marginalised members of society in any \\ndecision that we make, and to ensure that they benefit from it in \\nsome way. It is also a guide to confront our own existential \\ndifficulties. When we feel paralysed by doubt or entangled in \\npersonal problems and obsessions to the extent that we do not \\nknow what to do next, we can find liberation through an act of \\nempathetic imagining that suggests which path we should take. \\nThe talisman has the potential to provide clarity in our state of \\nconfusion or indecision. \\n The question that remains, however, is how do we know \\nwhat the poorest and weakest person actually needs? And what \\ndo we know about the needs and thoughts of others with whom \\nwe may wish to empathise, such as a prisoner on death row in \\nTexas, a Mayan peasant farmer from the Guatemalan Highlands, \\nor even a friend who is in the midst of an emotional crisis? \\n We must discover ways of deepening our empathy if we are \\nto succeed with Gandhi’s talisman. The mere act of imagining is \\nnot enough, for we risk imposing our own desires on others, \\njust as the Christian maxim would have us do. \\n It is possible to make a good attempt at deepening our \\nempathy with others, even those who may be very different \\nfrom us. There are three main ways of doing so: \\n  \\n/head2right\\n Learning  - about their beliefs, lives and cultures from \\nbooks, films, photos and other artworks and \\ninformation sources  \\n/head2right\\n Conversation  - with them that is both profound and \\npersonal, and which gets beyond superficial talk \\n/head2right Experience  - of how they live so that you can understand \\nwhat they have gone through for yourself.'),\n",

Rather than presenting a chronological narrative \\nof his life, Montaigne’s essays take the form of reflections on an \\nextraordinary range of themes, including idleness, friendship, \\ncannibals, the custom of wearing clothes, farting, experience, \\nimagination, impotence and education. Through these subjects \\nhe investigates and challenges himself, his beliefs, his emotions, \\nand his responses, guided by the question he had inscribed on a \\nmedal in 1576: Que sçais-je? What do I know? His essays show \\nnot only the mind of a sixteenth-century European nobleman, \\nbut also of an explorer who was more interested in discovering \\nhimself than distant lands. Yet the self he discovered was a place \\nfamiliar to all, for ‘every man bears the whole stamp of the \\nhuman condition’. \\n The tradition of autobiography that can be traced back to \\nMontaigne has had enormous influence in helping us imagine \\nthe lives of strangers, be they from different cultures, \\ngenerations, occupations or historical periods.

But sometimes \\nit can become a mass phenomenon that brings about large-scale \\nsocial change. Many of the most important shifts in history have \\ntaken place not when there has been a change in governments, \\nlaws or economic systems, when there has been a change in the \\nsocial fabric of empathy. That is, when significant numbers of \\nindividuals share new learning, conversations or experiences that \\nalter their understanding of particular groups of people, and \\nwhich provoke a major practical response. \\n Although you may think this is a subject for historians, it is \\nalso of relevance to the art of living.

After a protracted period of social struggle beginning \\naround 1787, the slave trade was finally abolished in 1807 and \\nslavery itself ended in the British Empire in 1838 (although it \\nstill continues today in countries such as Brazil, India and \\nChina).  \\n There are different interpretations of how and why this \\nchange took place. The traditional view was that the actions of \\nthe British parliamentarian William Wilberforce were the most \\nsignificant factor in bringing an end to slavery. More modern \\nanalysis emphasises the revolts by slaves themselves, and the \\nrole of the Anglican deacon Thomas Clarkson and a group of \\nhighly active Quakers who spearheaded the mass movement \\nagainst slavery.  \\n These explanations fail to recognise the crucial role of \\nempathy. According to the historian Adam Hochschild in his \\nbook Bury The Chains: The British Struggle to Abolish Slavery , the \\ncampaign against slavery relied upon a ‘sudden upwelling’ of \\nhuman empathy among the British public, remarkable for the \\nfact that ‘it was the first time a large number of people became \\noutraged, and stayed outraged for many years, over someone \\nelse’s rights’. But what explains this sudden upwelling, and why \\ndidn’t this response arise in other European countries? \\nHochschild argues that there was something that set Britain \\napart: ‘People are more likely to care about the suffering of \\nothers in a distant place if that misfortune evokes a fear of their \\nown. And late-eighteenth century Britons were in the midst of a \\nwidespread firsthand experience with a kind of kidnapping and \\nenslavement that stood in dramatic contradiction to everything \\nabout citizens’ rights enshrined in British law. It was arbitrary, \\nviolent, and sometimes fatal…It was the practice of naval \\nimpressment.’ \\n Since the 1600s the Royal Navy had ‘pressed’ tens of \\nthousands of seamen into service. This involved press gangs of \\narmed sailors patrolling around British ports and further inland, \\nforcibly taking any sturdy men they could find.

Campaigners against the slave trade drew direct parallels \\nwith the practice of impressment: the British public had an \\nunderstanding, often from personal or family experience, of \\nwhat it meant to be enslaved. Hence they could clearly see the \\ncruel injustice of slavery on the sugar plantations.

A former slave named Olaudah Equiano wrote a \\nbestselling autobiography and toured the country from the late \\n1780s, speaking to thousands of people about his experience, \\nand giving a human face and personal story to those who had \\nbeen enslaved.

Thus Hochschild concludes that the \\nsuccess of the anti-slavery movement was based on the fact that, \\n‘The abolitionists placed their hope not in sacred texts, but in \\nhuman empathy.’ \\n \\nThis is only one of many examples in which empathy has left its \\ntrace on history. Another grew out of the evacuation of over a \\nmillion British children from urban areas to the countryside \\nduring the Second World War. For the first time relatively well-\\noff rural people discovered the realities of life in the city slums, \\nbecause most of the children they were charged to look after \\nwere clearly deprived: they were malnourished, they suffered \\nfrom rickets and lice, they lacked shoes. The result was a surge \\nof empathy which led to new public health, nutritional and \\neducation provisions for children. These changes themselves \\naccelerated the development of the welfare state both during \\nand after the war.  \\n A further instance is the impact of Nicaragua’s mass literacy \\ncampaign in the early 1980s. As part of the new Sandinista \\ngovernment’s revolutionary policies, almost 100,000 young \\npeople from the cities (mostly student volunteers) had their first \\nmajor encounter with the acute poverty of the countryside \\nthrough working as literacy teachers. They lived and ate with \\npeasant families, got to know children and old people, and \\ndiscovered what it was like to struggle as an agricultural worker. \\nThese encounters with the socio-economic and cultural realities \\nof their own country affected the political and empathetic \\nconsciousness of an entire generation, and contributed to the \\ngrowth of vibrant and radical social movements in Nicaragua \\nthroughout the 1980s and 1990s. \\n Waves of mass empathy are also part of the more recent \\npast, such as the public reaction in Europe to the Asian tsunami \\nin late 2004, in which over 230,000 people were killed.

Researchers \\nhave also described the concept as the capacity to “walk in someone else’ s shoes” \\nand see the world from their perspective. It is comprised of emotional empathy, \\nwhich involves the ability to share the emotions of another person, and cognitive \\nempathy, which is the intellectual ability to understand another person’ s emotions \\nand mental state. Empathetic skill plays a key role in social life as it contributes \\nto promoting prosocial behavior and avoiding or limiting aggressive situations. \\nSpecifically, it is essential when the protagonists of the social interaction belong \\nto opposite social groups, such as race, age, gender, and formal or informal groups \\n(e.g., doctor versus patient, professor versus student, caregiver versus care recipi -\\nent). For example, the literature shows how sexual offenders have lower levels of \\nboth cognitive and emotional empathy than the general population. A possible \\nreason for this is that individuals with low levels of empathy do not understand \\nthe other person’ s distress and thus they are unable to take the perspective of the \\nvictim.\\nDue to its relevance to all aspects of life and interactions with others, empathy has \\nreceived interest and attention from social science and neuroscience to under -\\nstand the mechanisms behind empathetic skills and the possibility to train them. \\nFrom the neuroscience point of view , it has been investigated that the empathetic \\nrelationship involves mirror neurons that are activated when someone observes \\nand experiences emotions and that the medial prefrontal cortex is primarily \\ninvolved. Alternatively, clinical psychology has demonstrated how the ability \\nto be empathetic moderates levels of depression and anxiety and contributes to \\nincreasing positive emotions. However, it is interesting how often empathy and \\ncompassion, the latter of which is the feeling of care and concern for others, are \\ninterchangeable and how sometimes excessive levels of empathy can generate \\ncompassion fatigue. \\nRegarding empathy training programs, in the last decade, virtual reality (VR) \\nwas defined as an empathy machine. VR is a tridimensional and immersive envi -\\nronment and, thanks to the head-mounted display, permits the user to embody \\nanother body and feel the emotions of that avatar.\\nThis book discusses advanced research on empathy and its social impact. Chapters \\ncover theoretical models and innovative research in the field of empathy with \\nexperimental validation and high scientific value.'),\n",

Historically, emotional responses to \\npatients were seen as threats to objectivity and doctors strived for detachment to be \\nable to care, reliably, for all patients regardless of their personal feelings. Blumgart [6] \\nrecalls Sir William Osler’ s “ Aequanimitas” in his definition of ‘neutral empathy’ which \\nstates that a physician will do what needs to be done without feeling grief, regret, or \\nother difficult emotions. Osler argues that by neutralising their emotions to the point \\nthat they feel nothing in response to patient suffering, physicians can ‘see into’ and, \\nthereby, be able to ‘study’ the patient’ s ‘inner life’ [7].\\nTo avoid this conceived conflict between emotions and objectivity, ‘professional \\nempathy’ was defined, on purely ‘cognitive’ basis, as “the act of correctly acknowl-\\nedging the emotional state of another without experiencing that state oneself” [8]. \\nThis model of ‘detached concern’ assumes that knowing how the patient feels is no \\ndifferent from knowing that the patient is in a certain emotional state. However, the \\nfunction of empathy is to recognise what it feels like to experience something, not \\nmerely to label emotional states [9]. Halpern [9] emphasises that patients sense when \\nphysicians are ‘emotionally attuned’ and that patients trust ‘emotionally attuned’ \\nphysicians and adhere better to their treatment.\\nIn the clinical context, Stepien and Baernstein [10] combined the different defini-\\ntions within the literature to put forward an expanded definition of empathy. This \\nproposed definition includes four distinct dimensions: ‘moral, emotive, cognitive, and \\nbehavioural’ , all working in harmony to benefit the patient.\\n1.2 From empathy to compassion fatigue\\nEmpathic perspective-taking is the level of empathy which most psychologists refer \\nto when they speak of ‘empathy’ . In this view , empathy is a cognitive state—dependent \\non imagination and mental attribution—combined with emotional engagement. A \\nmajor manifestation of empathic perspective-taking is ‘targeted helping’ i.e., help and \\ncare based on a cognitive appreciation of the other’ s specific need or situation [11]. The \\nemotional component in providing care and support to people in distress can, over \\ntime, deplete the caregiver’ s emotional resources engendering ‘compassion fatigue’; \\nwhich is characterised by feelings of indifference to the suffering of others [12]. Joinson \\n[13] in 1992 described compassion fatigue as a form of ‘occupational burnout’ experi-\\nenced by those in the caring professions. Figley [14] then described compassion fatigue \\nas ‘caregiver burnout’ and his 2002 model of compassion fatigue emphasised “the costs \\nof caring, empathy, and emotional investment in helping the suffering” [15]. These \\n‘costs’ include the increased risk of mental and physical health problems in helping \\nprofessionals [16, 17]. Radey and Figley [12] suggest, “as our hearts go out to our clients \\nthrough our sustained compassion, our hearts can give out from fatigue” (p. 207).\\nCompassion fatigue exists across a diverse range of healthcare professional groups, \\ndisciplines, and specialties [18–20]. Close to 7% of professionals who work with trau -\\nmatised individuals exhibit emotional reactions that are similar to symptoms of post-\\ntraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This is not only seen in the healthcare sector, where \\nit has been demonstrated in physicians, psychotherapists, and nurses—especially \\nthose working with critically ill children, in oncology and in trauma care [21–24]—but \\nalso, beyond the hospital setting in first responders, emergency teams, social workers, \\npolice officers, migration workers, and those working with the homeless [25–29].\\nLevels of compassion fatigue have increased over the last decade [30]. More \\nrecently, compassion fatigue has become a significant concern during the COVID-19'),\n",

Recent pooled subscale scores indicate average to high levels \\ncompassion fatigue across a diverse healthcare practitioner groups [18]. For nurses, \\ncompassion fatigue rates are currently reported as just above 50% [35].\\n2. Aim of this chapter\\nThe aim of this narrative review is to describe and synthesise the literature to \\nexplore the associations between empathy and compassion fatigue, and the impact of \\nthe latter in the healthcare profession. Also, to examine screening and management \\nstrategies of compassion fatigue in HCPs and deduce a conclusion from the evidence.\\n3. Methodology\\nWe conducted a narrative review using the process described by Green et\\xa0al. [36] \\nto present objective conclusions based upon previously published literature that \\nwe have comprehensively reviewed. We opted for a narrative overview as narrative \\nreviews can often serve to provoke thought and controversy and may be an excellent \\nvenue for presenting philosophical perspectives in a balanced manner [36].\\n3.1 Identifying relevant studies\\nWe determined the search strategy through team discussions and pilot explora-\\ntions of the different databases. We searched MEDLINE (Ovid), APA PsycINFO \\n(EBSCOhost), and CINAHL Plus using the Boolean/Phrase (Empathy AND \\n(‘Compassion Fatigue’ OR ‘Vicarious Trauma’) AND Health). We conducted the \\nsearch during May and June of 2022 and included literature published between 2003 \\nand 2022, including articles published online ahead of print. Initial search recovered \\n290 results from MEDLINE, 112 from CINAHL Plus, and 215 from PsycINFO.\\n3.2 Study selection\\nEndNote X9 (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, PA, USA) was used to download \\nthe bibliographic details of studies yielded from the database searches and duplicates \\nwere deleted. Researchers screened article titles and abstracts to determine eligibility \\nfor full-text review based on relevance to the research topic. After this initial screen-\\ning, all researchers read full texts of articles to determine eligibility for inclusion.\\nInclusion criteria: The literature review included full text empirical research, \\nwhich described empathy and compassion fatigue in healthcare workers, published in \\nthe English language in academic peer-reviewed journals over the last 20\\xa0years.\\nExclusion criteria: Studies which covered other forms of vicarious trauma and \\npost-traumatic stress, and studies which explored compassion fatigue in other \\nprofessions, e.g., police officers, chaplaincy, caregivers, and migration agents, were \\nexcluded from this review .\\nFigure 1 shows a flowchart indicating the search and selection process.

The impact of compassion fatigue in healthcare\\n3. The detection and assessment of compassion fatigue\\n4. Management of compassion fatigue in healthcare professionals\\n4. Results\\nHCPs are continually exposed to stressful events in their day-to-day work includ-\\ning frequent encounters with: (a) death and dying, (b) grieving families, (c) personal \\ngrief, (d) traumatic stories, (e) observing extreme physical pain in patients, (f) \\nstrong emotional states such as anger and depression, and (g) emotional and physi-\\ncal exhaustion [37–39]. Over time, high levels of stress can lead to burnout [39, 40]. \\nBurnout, a much-researched topic in the helping professions, has been defined as \\n“a syndrome composed of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduction \\nof personal accomplishments” [41]. Burnout may also lead to negative self-concept, \\nnegative attitudes about work, and a loss of caring about work-related issues [38].\\nCompassion fatigue, a construct similar to burnout, is a topic that has emerged \\nin the literature in recent years [42–44]. Radley and Figley [12] define compassion as \\na “deep sense or quality of knowing or an awareness [among helping professionals] \\nof the suffering of another coupled with the wish to relieve it” (p. 207). Compassion \\nfatigue, a possible effect of long-term demonstrations of compassion, is defined as “a \\ndeep physical, emotional, and spiritual exhaustion accompanied by acute emotional \\npain” [45]. Compassion fatigue is thought to be a result of long exposure to the suf-\\nfering of others, listening to descriptions of traumatic events experienced by others, \\nlittle to no emotional support in the workplace, and poor self-care [12].\\n4.1 The connection between empathy and compassion fatigue\\nCompassion is an essential component of patient care provided by health pro-\\nfessionals [46]. The care-giving relationship is founded on empathy and a critical \\ncharacteristic of compassion fatigue is a loss or lack of empathy [47, 48].\\n4.1.1 Temporary lapses in empathy\\nTemporary lapses in empathy are not uncommon in professional intervention and \\ncan have a variety of causes, ranging from experiences in the professional’ s own life to \\nreactions to clients’ situation [49, 50]. Most clinicians experience them from time to \\ntime, and they rarely arouse major distress. There are reports of self-perceived lapses \\nof empathy among emergency workers who provide services in the acute phase of th e \\ndisaster and psychotherapists engaged in long-term psychotherapeutic relationships \\nthat started before and continued during and after the disaster. Many experience the \\nconflict of ‘attention-to-self versus attention-to-client’ as temporary and normal for \\nthe situation. Reports by these professionals suggest that their lapses in availability \\nand empathy cause them distress by impairing their self-esteem and fostering feelings \\nof guilt, shame, and inadequacy [51, 52].\\nBaum [53] suggests that the source of much of the widely reported distress among \\nclinicians is an intra-psychic conflict between two conflicting psychological needs: the \\nneed to distance themselves from their clients and their need to raise their self-esteem,'),\n",

The con-\\nflict from the fact that distancing helps the professionals to cope but reduces their ability \\nto empathise with their clients, can lead to feelings of guilt, shame, and self-reproach.\\nEmpathy is seen as comprising affective and cognitive components, whereas \\ncompassion is defined in terms of affective and behavioural elements. More specifi-\\ncally, compassion is perceived as comprising both of ‘feelings for’ the person who is \\nsuffering and a desire to act to relieve the suffering. The desire to act is distinct from \\nthe act itself [54, 55].\\nCompassion fatigue involves a decline in one’ s energy, desire, and/or ability to \\nlove, nurture, care for, or empathise with another’ s suffering [56–58]. These critical \\ndefining attributes were used to develop a theoretical definition: “Compassion fatigue \\nis the physical, emotional, and spiritual result of chronic self-sacrifice and/or pro-\\nlonged exposure to difficult situations that renders a person unable to love, nurture, \\ncare for, or empathize with another’ s suffering” [59].\\n4.1.2 Compassion fatigue and burnout\\nCompassion fatigue is strongly correlated with burnout [21, 60–62]. Whilst stress \\nand exhaustion are critical attributes of both concepts [21, 60] the experience is of \\nbeing in a ‘tired’ state in burnout and being in a ‘drained’ state in compassion fatigue \\n[60] and thus devoid of ones resources [14, 60].\\nWynn [60] performed a comparative concept analysis examining the terms \\n‘burnout’ and ‘compassion fatigue’ using Walker and Avant methodology. The \\nability to recognise both concepts is pivotal in helping to establish strategies that \\nsupport healthcare workers cope and achieve optimal occupational health. Wynn \\nnoted that burnout can be an antecedent of compassion fatigue. The important dif -\\nference is that burnout as a precursor may be more readily responsive than compas-\\nsion fatigue to restorative strategies such as time away from the work environment \\nand behaviour modification [14, 60]. If not addressed in its early stages compassion \\nfatigue can permanently alter the compassionate ability of the individual [63]. Thus \\ncompassion fatigue may be considered to be a consequence of ongoing burnout \\nin healthcare and indicate a further decline in the wellbeing of the healthcare \\nprofessional.\\nThe development of compassion fatigue is understood to be a cumulative and \\nprogressive process [64] Whist the development is cumulative, the onset of the \\nexperience compassion fatigue for the healthcare worker is a rapid one [35, 65]. \\nComparatively burnout, a larger overarching construct, is experienced as a slowly \\nprogressing disorder and is associated with working in burdensome organisational \\nenvironments [65]. Thus, in burnout conflict associated with the employer-employee \\nrelationship, and in compassion fatigue the conflict is primarily an internal one which \\nis associated with the relationship between the healthcare professional and their \\npatient [60, 66].\\n4.1.3 Vicarious trauma and secondary traumatic stress\\nMeadors et\\xa0al. [67] investigated the relationships between the terms associated \\nwith secondary traumatization using a correlational design. They established that \\nthere is a significant overlap between compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic stress'),\n",

Empathy and exposure are central in the development \\nof ST [72] and can alter the way in which the healthcare worker experiences self, \\nothers, and the world [73].\\nThe potential for ST begins with exposure to a client’ s experience that is sufficient \\nto evoke an arousal or emotional response [71, 74]. Vulnerability to the client’ s experi -\\nence may be heightened by pre-existing conditions (risk factors) that produce greater \\nsensitivity to the elements in the client’ s situation leading to one’ s absorption of the suf-\\nfering itself [70]. The vicarious experiencing of the feelings, thoughts, or attitudes of \\nanother may result in the development of empathy, or the emotional connection that \\noccurs through listening and bearing witness to graphic depictions of traumatic events. \\nWhile bearing witness to the client’ s suffering, the healthcare worker is susceptible \\nto responses or reactions that may be physiological, behavioural, emotional, and/or \\ncognitive in nature. Figley describes this as the “cost of caring” for those in emotional \\npain [71]. Alternate discussions such as those by Ledoux contest the notion of a ‘ cost to \\ncaring’ and propose that compassion fatigue occurs when ‘care is obstructed’ [54].\\nOsland [75] reported that dietitians in high-risk workloads reported higher levels \\nof STS than those with low-risk workloads, those in smaller facilities reported higher \\nSTS than larger facilities, and that working for >5\\xa0years as a dietitian was associated \\nwith higher rates of STS and burnout than in those working for <5\\xa0years. Those who \\nperceived greater levels of support reported lower rates of burnout and higher rates of \\ncompassion satisfaction.\\nZeidner et\\xa0al. [47] examined the role of some personal and professional factors in \\ncompassion fatigue among health-care professionals.

Furthermore, problem-focused coping appeared to mediate the associa-\\ntion between trait emotional intelligence and compassion fatigue. These findings \\nhighlighted the role of emotional factors in compassion fatigue among health-care \\nprofessionals [47].\\nRayner et\\xa0al. [76] examined STS and related factors of empathetic behaviour and \\ntrauma caseload among 190 social workers and psychologists. Approximately 30 \\npercent of participants met the criteria for a diagnosis of STS. Results indicated that \\nthere was a significant interaction between caseload trauma and personal trauma his-\\ntory on STS. Similarly, empathy alone was not directly related to changes in STS, yet \\nthe trauma in caseload effect on STS was moderated by empathy. A personal history \\nof trauma was found to be related to increased levels of STS. However, contrary to \\nexpectation of prior research, empathy contributed to a reduction in STS, meaning \\nthat lower empathy levels were associated with a higher risk of developing STS.\\nHubbard et\\xa0al. [77] demonstrated consistency between the five key concepts of \\nST discussed in the literature, i.e., exposure, vulnerability, empathic engagement, \\nreaction, and transformation. The analysis revealed a dynamic, fluid process in which \\nthe energy of the nurse, client, and environment were integrated and part of a diverse \\nwhole [78]. The dynamic nature of the nurses’ experiences created a “kaleidoscope of \\npotentialities” [78], the outcome of which was either a positive or a negative trajec-\\ntory. This revealed a new aspect of the dimension of alteration/transformation, which \\nwas the identification of a positive outcome during the ST process. These results \\nsuggest the importance of further research to assess the role and value of reflective \\nsupervision for HCPs and how this may enhance their personal and professional \\nresilience.\\n4.2 Risk factors for compassion fatigue\\nRisk factors for the development of compassion fatigue include the intensity of \\nthe patient setting as healthcare professionals who care for traumatised individu-\\nals in critical care environments are at greater risk of acquiring compassion fatigue \\n[20]. Engaging with the patients loved ones also places the healthcare professional \\nat risk, particularly if the interactions involve conflict [20]. Other factors that place \\nthe professional at risk including undertaking difficult discussion with patients and \\nfamilies such as breaking bad or uncertain news to patients and their families. A lack \\nof perceived managerial support compounds the risk [20, 65] and working more \\nhours perpetuates emotional exhaustion in providers [79].\\nPersonal factors also appear to play a role in the risk of the development of com-\\npassion fatigue. Those who have less experience working as a healthcare professional \\nare at greater risk [20, 80] as are those with less maturity [80] or those who have not \\nacquired a higher level of education or qualification in their profession [35, 46].\\nPoor coping strategies and difficulty with emotional regulation also place provid-\\ners at greater risk. These include being unable to process feelings in relation to trauma \\nand caring for those who are impacted by suffering [20, 47]. Being unable to identify \\neffective coping mechanisms, adapt, manage emotion and develop one’ s emotional \\nintelligence [20, 47]\\nThere is some indication that one’ s personality may also play a role and people \\nwith high sensitivity may be more vulnerable to compassion fatigue.

This may be \\ncompounded by the contract between the quality of care the healthcare professional \\nmay want to provide with what they are actually able to achieve [80].\\nNegative life events and pre-existing mental illnesses such as anxiety or depression \\nhave been found to increases a person’ s susceptibility for compassion fatigue [18]. \\nSimilarly coexisting physical and emotional stress increases levels of existing compas-\\nsion fatigue [80].\\nCertain workplace conditions and events are more likely to trigger the onset of \\ncompassion fatigue [60]. These include continuous and intense contact with patients, \\nexposure to high levels of stress, exposure to suffering and work which requires a high \\nuse of self [83].\\n4.3 The impact of compassion fatigue\\nCompassion fatigue negatively impacts the healthcare professional, the patient, \\nthe organisation, and the healthcare system [19].\\n4.3.1 Impact on the healthcare professional\\nIn order to support patient autonomy healthcare providers practice patient \\ncentred care. This care requires genuine engagement and an empathetic approach \\nmaking exposure to patient trauma and suffering unavoidable for the health care \\nprofessional [79].\\n4.3.1.1 Signs of compassion fatigue\\nIndicators of compassion fatigue frequently cited in the literature include \\nexhaustion [14, 60], reduced capacity for self-care [13, 60], ineffective coping, poor \\njudgement [83], inability to function [63, 83], loss of empathy [60, 83] and deperson-\\nalisation of patients [83].\\n4.3.1.1.1 Exhaustion\\nThe experience of the depth of exhaustion has a number of descriptors in the \\nliterature. These include a include feelings of weariness [63, 64] emptiness, of being \\ndrained [14, 60] and a ‘profound fatigue of mind and body’ [80]. People with com-\\npassion fatigue feel completely depleted of one’ s “biological, psychological, and social \\nresources” [14] such that they have nothing more to give [14, 60]. The individual \\nwants to rest although concerningly rest does not result in increased energy levels or a \\nsense of rejuvenation [14, 60]. Individuals may try various attempts to replenish and \\nyet the feeling of exhaustion remains [14, 60].\\n4.3.1.1.2 Reduced capacity for self-care\\nIn 1992 Joinson described compassion fatigue as the reduced capacity to self-care \\nas a result of the sustained fatigue acquired by caring for others [13]. Recent syn-\\nthesised descriptions of the experience of compassion fatigue include being left so \\nphysically and mentally exhausted and drained by patient care that the provider lacks \\nempathy and is unable to cope [60].'),\n",

When healthcare professionals are no longer able to recover from a depleted \\nstate despite using coping strategies the result is ineffective coping [60]. Coping strat-\\negies that may have worked successfully in the past become no longer effective [60]. \\nRecovery from the stress and exhaustion of providing patient care [60], is no longer \\npossible. Emotional responses may include feeling emotionally overwhelmed [63, 84, \\n85] and potentially experiencing an emotional breakdown [15, 20, 63].\\n4.3.1.1.4 I\\n\\x19 \\x0f \\x0e \\x14 \\t \\x14 \\x15 \\x0b \\x15 o function\\nInability to function may be experienced as a diminished ability [15] or reduced \\nendurance and output [63, 83], leading to a diminished or ineffective work perfor-\\nmance [13, 63, 83]. The experience of trauma-based symptoms, in addition to signifi-\\ncant exhaustion results in a deterioration of function [63]. The compassionate energy \\nrequired to care for patients has been consumed over time is distinguished beyond \\nthe point of possible replenishment. An inability to compassionately care for patients \\nmoves beyond the work environment and leads to an inability to function which \\nimpacts all aspects of the professionals life [63].\\n4.3.1.1.5 Loss of empathy\\nWhilst attempting to employ coping strategies to manage the stress of caregiving a \\nloss of empathy occurs. In response to the relentless overwhelming stress and resultant \\nexhaustion of care-giving a deep psychological shift occurs [60, 86]. Health profes -\\nsionals lose their sensitivity to and understanding of the patient’ s needs. The profes-\\nsional is no longer able to comprehend the patient’ s perspectives or recognise their \\nthoughts and feelings [60, 86]. Thus patient experiences are no longer relatable and \\nthe health professional experiences compassion fatigue [60, 86]. Factors that inhibit \\nsustained energy and perpetuate compassion fatigue include time constraints, burnout \\n[87] and caring for high-stakes patients [60]. Health professionals with their own \\npersonal history of trauma are also at greater risk of acquiring compassion fatigue [88] \\ndue to their sensitivity to secondary traumatic stress [76]. As a consequence of their \\nempathy loss, the healthcare professional appears indifferent [14, 15], unresponsive \\n[63], callous [15, 84, 89] and unable to share in or alleviate the patients suffering [15].\\n4.3.1.1.6 Depersonalisation\\nDepersonalisation is a sense of detachment from oneself in which individuals per-\\nform tasks in a robotic fashion without emotion. It presents as a coping mechanism \\nused to manage exhaustion [90] and to avoid the feelings of distress that may arise \\nwhen a person is experiencing compassion fatigue. Whilst the response does not arise \\nfrom a lack of empathy for the patient [60] the depersonalisation coping mechanism \\nonce triggered in the professional results in a lack human feelings or emotions in the \\nwork place. Consequently, this translates to a lack of human feelings in how the pro-\\nfessional provides care, which results in substandard care [83]. The serious implica-\\ntions of depersonalisation in healthcare professionals arises when the lack of emotion \\nin self, results in the professional viewing the patient as also inert or an ‘object’ and \\napproaches the patient with an attitude of indifference [90].'),\n",

This emotionally dissociated approach sharply contrasts \\nwith anticipated patient expectations.\\n4.3.1.2 Symptoms of compassion fatigue\\nCompassion fatigue is a significant risk factor for well-being [20, 25]. Compassion \\nfatigue impacts ones physical and mental health [63, 64] and leading to an array of \\npotentiation indicators including psychological, physical, spiritual, and social symp-\\ntoms [86]. As the condition progresses the professional experiences an increase in \\nthe scope and severity of symptoms [63]. For example the individual may experience \\nphysical symptoms of burnout, reduced work performance and physical complaints, \\nthe intellectual effects of impaired concentration, emotional effects of breakdown, \\nthe social symptoms of indifference towards patients and desire to quit, the spiritual \\neffects of disinterest in introspection and dysfunctional coping behaviours [63].\\n4.3.1.2.1 Physical symptoms\\nPhysical symptoms may include health complaints, intellectual effects and fatigue \\n[15, 63]. Health complaints may include gastrointestinal conditions and stomach pain, \\nand headaches, including migraine [20, 83, 91]. Sleep disturbance is frequently cited \\n[20, 65, 91, 92] and people may be at greater risk of accidents [15,\\xa083]. Intellectual \\neffects include impaired ability to concentrate [13–15, 63], poor judgement [20] and \\ndisorganisation [63, 89]. Fatigue may manifest as weariness [63, 85] lack of energy \\n[13, 15, 63, 85, 89] loss of strength [63, 85] loss of endurance [63, 85] and power \\nof\\xa0physical recovery [63] Complications of fatigue include weight gain or weight \\nloss\\xa0[83].\\n4.3.1.2.2 Psychological impact\\nThe psychological impact of compassion fatigue is well established in the litera-\\nture and manifests as stress, burnout [13], intrusive and pervasive thoughts [65, 91] \\nanxiety [13, 63, 64], and depression [13, 20, 60, 63–65]. Compassion fatigue has been \\nfound to have a moderate correlation with anxiety and depression [93].\\n4.3.1.2.3 Emotional impact\\nThe emotional impact of a loss of compassion is typically one of devastation for \\nthose in healthcare professions [13]. Compassion for others drives workplace motiva-\\ntion to serve and alleviate suffering [54]. People in nurturing roles are rewarded for \\nputting others needs ahead of their own [13], and ethically a drive to nurture others \\nconnects with the ideal archetype of those in caring professions and a societal sense of \\nsocial justice [54].\\nEmotional exhaustion and its consequential impact on one’ s personal life are the \\nmost frequently reported emotional effects of compassion fatigue [20, 94].

Individuals feel emotionally distressed or bereft and may well experi-\\nence an emotional breakdown [15, 60, 63, 65, 80, 83].\\nIndicators of compassion fatigue may include fluctuations in emotional states  \\n[91, 92] or mood swings [20]. Impacted healthcare professionals may feel emotionally \\noverwhelmed [63, 84, 85], irritable [14, 20, 63, 64] angry, fearful, out of control [13]. \\nor apathetic [13, 63, 84]. Ones outlook is likely to become negative [60] and people \\nexperience ‘work related dreads’ . [91] Healthcare professionals are no longer able to \\nfeel empathy for those in their care or respond compassionately. They have an inabil-\\nity to share in, or alleviate suffering [15] and may respond with indifference [14, 15], \\ncallousness [15, 84, 89] or be unresponsiveness [63] to patients at times when they \\npreviously would have been empathetic.\\nSpiritual effects include a lack of spiritual awareness and disinterest in \\nintrospection [15, 63, 85] which has the potential to result in poor judgement \\n[15, 63] cynical humour and dysfunctional coping behaviours such an increased \\nconsumption of alcohol, unhealthy food or pornography [91]. The impact is a loss \\nof self-worth [95] which may be compounded by weight gain or loss [83] and its \\nemotional impact.\\n4.3.2 The impact of compassion fatigue on patients\\nPatient care is negatively impacted by compassion fatigue and this impact is rec-\\nognisable to patients. Health professionals effected by compassion fatigue experience \\na decreased ability to feel empathy and hence lack meaning in their work [20,\\xa096]. \\nwhich results in substandard care [20, 83, 96]. The stress of the working environ-\\nment is palpable to patients and is identifiable as a consequence of poor-quality care \\n[60,\\xa097]. Patients depend on health professionals to alleviate the stress, anxiety and \\nfear associated with their illness [90]. When patients sense the impact of compassion \\nfatigue they question the quality and appropriateness of care which in turn escalates \\npatient stress [60].\\nThe relationship between the healthcare professional and the patient becomes \\ncompromised. The trauma response associated with compassion fatigue results in \\nreduced or decreased workplace engagement [21] and avoidance of particular situa-\\ntions or patients [96]. The ultimate consequence of compassion fatigue and burnout is \\npoor patient outcomes [60]. Indeed significant concerns arise regarding the potential \\nfor increased medical errors and patient safety [21, 64, 83].\\n4.3.3 The impact of compassion fatigue on organisations and the healthcare system\\nStaff who are experiencing compassion fatigue have reduced job satisfaction \\n[21] and reduced efficiency levels resulting in reduced service quality [98]. Patient \\nsatisfaction levels are lower in institutions where job satisfaction and burnout levels \\nare reduced [97]. Poor patient satisfaction levels result in reduced patient recommen-\\ndation rates of same facility to family and friends [60, 97].\\nRelationships with co-workers become negatively impacted [20, 96] when a \\nperson is impacted by compassion fatigue. If working with colleagues who are equally \\nexhausted and apathic [13] productivity and workplace morale decline [95]. The \\nresult is a poor work environment with lower levels of productivity, patient satisfac-\\ntion and patient care outcomes [21]. Compassion fatigue is triggered by the ongoing \\nuse of empathy while caring for those who are suffering and the effect of a poor work \\nenvironment [18, 99]. Thus, the cycle of compassion fatigue perpetuates.'),\n",

More staff members experi-\\nence an intensifying desire to leave their workplace, profession [15, 24, 60] and spe-\\ncialty [80]. Compassion fatigue and burnout result in workplace imbalances [24,\\xa060] \\nwith higher rates of staff turnover [95], and attrition and eventually, workforce \\ndropout [98]. Staff turnover rates are particularly volatile in in high-stakes environ-\\nments [100] such as oncology and emergency medicine. Staff seek alternate employ-\\nment opportunities in an attempt to combat excessive workplace stress. As turnover \\nrates increase, the stress in the workplace intensifies as remaining staff attempt to \\ncontinue short staffed [60].\\nCompounding the impact of compassion fatigue is the perception that indicators \\nof a poor working environment, such as increased rates of absenteeism, reduced \\nservice quality, low levels of efficiency are being ignored by the organisation and \\nhealthcare system [18, 98]. Concerns include the conclusion by staff that admin -\\nistrators do not consider caregiver stress when allocating tasks [13]. The impact \\nof compassion fatigue is intensified when management fail to provide workplace \\nacknowledgement, fail to provide opportunities for peer support and appear not \\nto value work-life balance [80]. When the workplace culture is not addressed with \\nopportunity for employee training, and a shift towards a compassionate organisa -\\ntional culture [65] staff in healthcare will continue to experience moderate to high \\nlevels of compassion fatigue.\\nAs a consequence of the negative impact on productivity, job satisfaction and staff \\nturnover, compassion fatigue also impedes workplace focus on patient safety [21] and \\nthus has the potential to lead to an increase in medical errors and diminished patient \\noutcomes [21]. Healthcare professionals experiencing burnout and compassion \\nfatigue are more prone to medical error [83] as a result of compassion fatigue symp-\\ntoms including exhaustion [14, 60] and a diminished work performance [13, 63, 83].\\nIn addition to the potential harm to patients and families, compassion fatigue \\nrelated medical error has the potential to result in legal, reputational and economic \\nloss, for individual healthcare providers [101]. The economic impact of an institution \\nimpacted by compassion fatigue staff turnover, patient dissatisfaction and concerns \\nregarding medical error and patient safety is institutional financial loss [64, 102–104]. \\nCompassion is valued by patients and healthcare professionals alike and both patients \\nand professionals raise concerns regarding a widespread and escalating lack of \\ncompassion in healthcare systems [30, 101].\\n4.4 Detection and assessment of compassion fatigue\\nCompassion fatigue is commonly measured using the Professional Quality of \\nLife Scale (ProQOL) [105, 106]. The self-score scale is a freely available to measure \\nthe negative and positive effects of caring and helping others who have experiences \\nsignificant trauma or suffering.\\nThe Compassion Fatigue Self- Test (CFST) was originally developed to measure \\ncompassion fatigue [107]. The CFST measures the level of risk of an individual to \\ndeveloping compassion fatigue. The scale included 40 items, divided into two sub-\\nscales, compassion fatigue and job burnout; 23 items measure compassion fatigue and \\n17 items burnout.

Scores on the subscale for burnout below 36 indicated an extremely low risk, \\nbetween 37 and 50 moderate risk, 51–75 indicates high risk, and scores between 76 \\nand 85 indicated an extremely high risk of burnout. The reported internal consistency \\nalphas are reported to be between .86 to .94 [108]. The scale has been widely used in \\na variety of settings and has adequate reliability and validity [69]. The measure was \\nspecifically developed to measure both direct and indirect trauma making it a widely \\napplied measure [108].\\nThe CFST scale was revised and re-developed [106] into the Professional Quality \\nof Life (ProQOL). The revised scale included an additional subscale to measure \\ncompassion satisfaction. The three subscales total 30 items, using a six-point scale \\n(0\\xa0=\\xa0never, 1\\xa0=\\xa0rarely, 2\\xa0=\\xa0a few times, 3\\xa0=\\xa0somewhat, 4\\xa0=\\xa0often, 5\\xa0=\\xa0very often). \\nRespondents are asked about their thoughts, feelings and behaviour at work. The \\nfirst of the three sub-scales measures compassion satisfaction, a higher score on this \\nscale represents a greater satisfaction as a caregiver and helping others. The second \\nsubscale, measures burnout and feelings of hopelessness at not being able to do a good \\njob, and the third subscale measures compassion fatigue/secondary traumatic stress. \\nA higher score on this subscale represents high levels of compassion fatigue/second-\\nary traumatic stress. Each subscale includes 10 items, and the subscale scores cannot \\nbe combined to calculate a total score. The ProQOL scale improved on the psycho-\\nmetric properties of the CFST scale [105, 106]. The scale with the additional subscale \\nmeasuring compassion satisfaction incorporates the more positive and psychologi-\\ncally protective aspect of caring, capturing the rewarding and gratifying aspects of \\ncaring [105, 106]. The Cronbach’ s α values reported by Stamm for these scales were \\n.82 for compassion satisfaction, .71 for burnout, and .78 for compassion fatigue [105]. \\nThe ProQOL is free to use and is readily available, as are guidelines for interpreting \\nthe results from the scale.\\n4.5 Management of compassion fatigue in healthcare professionals\\nFigley [70] believed to manage compassion fatigue in health professional a mul-\\ntifaceted approach is required that includes prevention, assessment and minimising \\nthe consequences. The impacts of compassion fatigue are far reaching for both the \\nindividual health professional and organisations. Helping protect healthcare profes-\\nsionals from developing compassion fatigue and managing those experiencing high \\nlevels of job burnout and secondary traumatic stress can be done through self-care, \\nevidence-based interventions and creating organisations that are better able to sup-\\nport and protect their workers. By protecting health professionals ensures high quality \\npatient care. Over the past few decades’ interventions have been developed to help \\nreduce symptoms of compassion fatigue. Self-care techniques that can be used to help \\nreduce the risk of developing compassion fatigues and managing the risks of provid-\\ning compassionate care to patients and clients have been developed and promoted \\namong health care professionals. Organisations also play a role in helping reduce the \\nrisk to their workers through better training, ongoing support and creating a support \\nenvironment that recognises the risks to their staff.\\n4.5.1 Interventions for compassion fatigue\\nInterventions have been developed to both prevent and manage compas-\\nsion fatigue in healthcare professionals.

The Accelerated Recovery \\nProgram (ARP) is a program developed to reduce compassion fatigue, including \\nsecondary traumatic stress and burnout in healthcare professionals. The ARP was \\noriginally developed in 1997 [110], based on Figley’ s work on compassion fatigue \\n(1995). The main aim of the program is to build resilience skills to prevent compas-\\nsion fatigue. The program duration is 5\\xa0weeks, consisting of a weekly 90–120-minute \\ntraining sessions. A full assessment is undertaken in the first session, along with a dis-\\ncussion exploring the symptoms participants are experiencing. In the second session \\ntreatment goals and a timeline is discussed using self-visualisation techniques. The \\nthird session focuses on reframing and reprocessing the trauma experienced using \\neye movement desensitisation and reprocessing therapy and reviewing self-regulation \\nstrategies for managing situations. The fourth session incorporates video-dialogue \\ntechniques to enable the individuals to supervise themselves through the development \\nof externalisation techniques. In the final session, closure and aftercare are addressed \\nwith the use of Pathways to recovery that include skill acquisition; self-care; connec-\\ntion with others; and internal conflict resolution. The program works by developing a \\nperson’ s self-awareness of compassion fatigue and practicing regular self-care activi-\\nties [110]. The ARP primarily focused on mental health and trauma workers [110] but \\nits potential to be effective in reducing compassion fatigue among nurses and other \\nhealthcare profession is growing [24]. Evidence supports the use of the ARP to reduce \\ncompassion fatigue among health care professionals [24, 111, 112]. An adaptation of \\nthe ARP that reduced the training into a single four-hour session reported a similar \\nsignificant reduction in compassion fatigue [113].\\nThe Compassion Fatigue Resiliency program (CFRP) was based on the concepts of \\nthe ACP [110]. The program is a five-week formalised program to educate participants \\nabout compassion fatigue, the factors that contribute to it and the effects of chronic \\nstress. The program interventions aim to reduce the effects of compassion fatigue \\nwith participants taking part in small group activities that allow them to build resil-\\nience through self-regulation, intentionality, self-validation, connection and self-care.\\nEvidence supports the effectiveness of the CRRP to reduce secondary traumatic \\nstress by providing nurses with the ability to manage intrusive thoughts [24]. The pro-\\ngram aids greater relaxation enabling individuals to better manage perceive threats, \\nenabling them to manage chronic stress through self-regulation [114]. The benefits of \\nthe CFRP have been reported for healthcare providers in reducing the symptoms of \\ncompassion fatigue [115–117].\\nTo improve the resilience of military healthcare professionals and reduce com-\\npassion fatigue the Army’ s Care Provider Support Program (CPSP) was developed. \\nDuring one-hour sessions, healthcare providers are educated to be able to assess \\nthemselves for compassion fatigue and identify when they need to take action. The \\nprogram activities focus on developing self-awareness through group discussion and \\ninteractive participation, along with providing education on stress and resilience. \\nSupport for the intervention significantly reducing burnout was demonstrated \\nby Weidleich et\\xa0al. [118]. However, although a decrease in secondary trauma was \\nreported this was not significant [118].\\nOverall, the usefulness of formal intervention programs developed to target reduc-\\ning compassion fatigue have been reported in a number of healthcare professionals. \\nAlthough, there is only limited evidence to support the effectiveness of the CPSP . \\nDespite the evidence to support the use of these intervention programs provided in \\nthis section, due to the nature of health care settings it is not always practical or cost \\neffective to run these programs for staff. Staff would be expected to attend these'),\n",

Self-care interventions are commonly prescribed for health professions experi-\\nencing compassion fatigue. Successfully managing compassion fatigue can be done by \\ndeveloping strategies that enhance awareness and provide thoughtful self-care [119]. \\nThere are numerous self-care strategies that can be adopted and utilised by healthcare \\nprofessionals.\\nStrategies and techniques that can be used to reduce the risk of compassion fatigue \\ninvolve looking after general wellbeing, including diet, exercise and sleep. Evidence \\nsupports maintaining a healthy diet and getting the recommended amount of physical \\nexercise help regulates mood [120] and reduce the risk of compassion fatigue [121]. \\nRegular sleep also plays an important role in regulating mood. Sleep deprivation is \\nassociated with decrease cognitive performance and increases the risk of low mood \\nsuch as anxiety and anger [122].\\nNurturing the self can be done using a number of different techniques. Deve loping \\nand practicing self-compassion can increase a person psychological wellbeing and \\nassist professionals to better respond to the difficulties experienced in their jobs [123, \\n124]. Self-care interventions developed aim to help healthcare professionals achieve \\nwork-life balance by developing coping skills to maintain both emotional and physical \\nhealth [125], along with maintaining healthy social networks and participating in \\nactivities to promote relaxation such as meditation and mindfulness [126, 127]. Other \\nself-care activities that can be adopted to help to support emotional wellbeing involve \\ncreative writing [128]. Strategies have included the use of writing poems to explore \\ndifficulties with emotional connection [129], or the use of creative cafes to reaffirm \\nthe core values involved in nursing [130].\\n4.5.3 Peer support programs\\nPeer support programs can be effective strategies to support healthcare profes-\\nsionals to help mitigate compassion fatigue. Encouraging individuals to utilise their \\nsocial support networks has a protective quality, by providing opportunities to \\nprocess traumatic experiences at work [131]. Chambers [132] developed the Care for \\nCaregivers program for physicians, nurses and other frontline staff. The staff were \\ntrained in peer support techniques that covered active listening, normalising emo-\\ntions, reframing situations, sharing stories and offering ideas of coping mechanisms. \\nThe program was reported as being well utilised by staff members, especially those \\ndealing with patients experiencing trauma or patient death. Within 2 years of the \\nprogram running staff surveys reported an increase in feeling adequately supported \\nby the hospital from 16% to 86%, helping change the workplace culture to being more \\nemphatic [132].\\n4.5.4 Protection through training\\nPreventing healthcare from the risks of developing compassion fatigue can be \\nincluded in training programs.

For example, trauma therapists utilising evidence-base practices when \\ntreating their clients had significantly decreased amounts of compassion fatigue \\nand burnout compared to specialists not using evidence-based practices [133]. This \\ndemonstrates the use of evidence-based practices to prevent the negative outcomes \\nof compassion fatigue therefore improving both the therapists and clients experience \\nof therapy [133, 134]. A study by Deighton [135] reported the exposure to the clients \\ntraumatic event was not as important in therapists developing compassion fatigue as \\nthe therapist’ s t ability to help the client work through their trauma [135]. Being able \\nto identify possible strategies to be better equipped to deal with exposure to clients’ \\ntraumas can reduce the impact on healthcare professionals.\\n4.5.5 Culture change in healthcare facilities\\nOrganisations can help mitigate the effects of compassion fatigue experienced by \\ntheir employees. Organisations need to assess whether and to what extent compassion \\nfatigue is a concern of their workers to be able to start to address the problem [136]. \\nPrevention is recommended as the first line of defence against compassion fatigue \\n[137]. Organisations should provide regular education and training around the \\nimportance of building employees self-care routines [138]. The Hospital, University \\nPennsylvania, is an example of an organisation that has provided their own wellness \\nprograms to support their staff. A Centre for Nursing Renewal was developed to \\nminimise the ill effects of compassion fatigue and promote wellness among its staff \\n[139]. The centre offered relaxation, meditation, yoga, group exercise classes, along \\nwith other classes and spaces to support nurses emotional and physical wellbeing. The \\ncentre assisted in creating a culture where nurse leaders were increasing awareness of \\nnurses experiencing compassion fatigue and burnout and could therefore encourage \\nstaff to engage in discussion and renewal practices such as exercise, talking, reflection \\nand getting adequate rest [139].\\nStaff wellness programs and initiatives have been implemented and trialled in \\nother health care providers organisations. These programs range in the types of \\nresources provided, include from professional counselling, employee health screen-\\ning, role modelling, mentor program, o providing healthy snacks and relaxation. \\nThese types of programs offered by organisations and led by trained professional can \\nhelp reduce compassion fatigue [119, 128]. These include employee health screening, \\nrole modelling, mentor program and staff retreats.\\nStaff wellness programs and initiatives have been implemented and trialled in \\nother organisations.

Limitations of this review\\nWhile every attempt was made to search the appropriate databases for articles sys-\\ntematically, it is important to note that this is not a systematic review . The search was \\nlimited to three major databases: MEDLINE (Ovid), APA PsycINFO (EBSCOhost), \\nand CINAHL Plus using the Boolean/Phrase (Empathy AND (“Compassion Fatigue” \\nOR “Vicarious Trauma”) AND Health). Two main limitations influenced the studies \\nidentified by the database search; the first was not including the term “Secondary \\nTraumatic Stress” as an alternative to “Vicarious Trauma” in the search terms, and \\nthe second was limiting the search to literature published between 2003 and 2022 and \\nmissing essential articles published in the 90s. These dates were initially selected due to \\nthe escalation in volume of relevant publications during that timeframe. Fortunately, \\nthese limitations were identified by the authors during the review process and were \\ncorrected by including all relevant secondary sources which retrieved the essential \\narticles before 2003 in addition to studies examining Secondary Traumatic Stress.\\n6. Conclusion\\nEmpathy and compassion are fundamental aspirations for HCPs as they provide \\nthem with job satisfaction, a sense of value, as well as greatly benefiting their patients. \\nHowever, caring and supporting people in distress can, over time, lead to compassion \\nfatigue which negatively impacts the healthcare professional, the patient, the organ-\\nisation, and the healthcare system. Although there are clear risk factors, identifying \\ntools and effective strategies to support and manage those experiencing compassion \\nfatigue, compassion fatigue in HCPs continues to grow reaching alarming levels over \\nthe last decade. Further research is needed to quantify the escalation and impact of \\ncompassion fatigue, and in a broader array of healthcare professionals. Exploration of \\nthe unique impact of loss of compassion beyond the experience of burnout is also an \\narea requiring an enhanced understanding.\\nWe propose that organisations implement regular screening and targeted support \\nfor at-risk individuals. More practical strategies could be provided from an organisa -\\ntional level to prevent the development of compassion fatigue in HCPs and support \\nstaff to provide the best patient care in a safe and nurturing environment. Ensuring a \\npositive work culture, which includes peer support programs, is a managerial respon-\\nsibility. Evidence supports the use of formal intervention programs such as CFRP and \\nthe ARP to be effective in reducing compassion fatigue, yet these programs required \\nthe HCP to commit a substantial amount of time, usually outside of their working \\nday. For the benefits of these programs to reach HCP , shorter programs preferably \\naccessible during work hours could be incorporated. Future research should focus on \\nidentifying components of these programs that could be adapted into modified shorter \\ntraining sessions that could become part of ongoing professional development.\\nCrucially, we propose that ensuring adequate staffing levels be a key responsibility \\nof management and, therefore, we advise the meticulous implementation of quality \\nassurance, evaluation, and formal reporting of staffing ratios.'),\n",

Finally, information is provided how empathy is related to burn \\nout by health care professionals.\\n2. Definitions of empathy\\nIn a review on empathy, Engelen and Röttger-Rössler [1] stated, “ Almost anybody \\nwriting in the field would declare that there is no accepted standard definition of \\nempathy—either among the sciences and humanities or in the specific disciplines. ” \\nErgo, there have been multiple definitions of empathy over the past century [2, 3]. \\nAt this point in time, it is generally accepted that empathy can be divided into two \\nbroad categories: affective or vicarious empathy and cognitive or role-taking empa -\\nthy. This leads to the dilemma on whether these two aspects of empathy, i.e. under -\\nstanding what another is thinking vs. understanding what the other is feeling, are \\nseparate or not, since the first is a cognitive function intimately relying on Theory \\nof Mind (ToM) as part of the process [4, 5], whereas the latter is a more archaic \\nemotional function that uses phylogenetically older parts of the CNS. Both of these \\naspects of empathy depend on the person recognizing, or identifying, the other \\nperson is equal in some respect, i.e. the person being viewed needs to be considered \\nas yourself in whatever particular situation the other person is in.\\nOriginally, the English word empathy was translated from the German word \\n“Einfühlung” which means “feeling into. ” This German word was used to describe the \\nfeelings one gets by observing things of beauty, e.g. artwork and nature, and appreciat-\\ning their esthetics. The translation into “empathy” (from the ancient Greek empatheia \\n(passion); composed of “en” (in) and “pathos” (feeling)) was coined by psychologist \\nEdward Titchener in 1909 [6]. Titchener was familiar with, and influenced by, the work \\nof David Hume who stated, “the minds of men are mirrors to one another” [7, 8]. As \\ntime advanced, various researchers, e.g. Lockwood [9], basically defined “empathy” as \\nbeing able to vicariously experience and understand the affect another person is emot-\\ning. Therefore, Einfühlung is not only an emotional, cognitive state, where you under-\\nstand what another feels, but it also evokes an affective, autonomic reaction within a \\nperson, a “gut feeling” if you will, by feeling what the other person is experiencing.\\nEngelen and Röttger-Rössler [1] define empathy as, “ A social feeling that consists \\nin feelingly grasping or retracing the present, future, or past emotional state of \\nanother. ” In their definition, empathy is a vicarious emotion where the ability to \\nseparate feeling from comprehending is not clearcut. In 2012, H. Walter [10] probably \\nproposed the most complex definition of empathy. He suggests that affective empathy \\nis, “(a) An affective state that is (b) elicited by the perceived or imagined, or inferred \\nstate of the affective state of another; (c) is similar (isomorphic) to the other’ s affec-\\ntive state; (d) is oriented toward the other; and (e) includes at least some cognitive \\nappreciation of the other’ s affective state comprising perspective-taking, self—other \\ndistinction, and knowledge of the causal relation between the self and the other’ s \\naffective state. ” Walter also indicates that cognitive empathy “Refers to the ability  to \\nunderstand the feelings of others without necessarily implying the empathizer is in an'),\n",

For further historical insights about the study of \\nempathy, see these other excellent reviews [11–13].\\n3. The development of empathy survey instruments\\nThe use of empathy throughout the development of human cultures promotes \\nharmonious social interactions [11]. Since effective patient care is largely dependent on \\nsocial interactions between the physician and the patient, its importance in the health \\nprofessions became an issue of concern and considerable research over the past four \\ndecades. In this regard, social scientists took an interest in studying empathy and con-\\ntributed their own definitions and measurement scales. In 1983, M.H. Davis [14] defined \\nempathy using a multidimensional approach, i.e. both the affective and cognitive \\ncomponents, as the “reactions of one individual to the observed experiences of another. ” \\nIn 1980, he developed the widely used Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) which parses \\nout four aspects of what he defines as the social aspects of empathy, i.e. social function-\\ning, self-esteem, emotionality, and sensitivity to others [15]. Consequently, the IRI scale \\nexamines perspective-taking, which assesses the tendencies to spontaneously adopt the \\npsychological viewpoint of others; Fantasy, which assesses the tendency to transpose \\nthemselves imaginatively into the feelings and actions of fictional characters in books, \\nmovies, and plays; Empathic Concern assesses other-oriented feelings of sympathy and \\nconcern for unfortunate others; and Personal Distress measures self-oriented feelings of \\npersonal anxiety and unease in tense interpersonal settings.\\nA large advancement in the field of cognitive empathy took place in 2002, when Dr. \\nM. Hojat and colleagues [16] developed an excellent definition of what they term as \\n“clinical empathy. ” This definition of cognitive empathy is used in the context of health \\ncare professions education and patient care as, “ A predominantly cognitive (rather than \\nan affective or emotional) attribute that involves an understanding (rather than a feeling) \\nof pain and suffering of the patient combined with a capacity to communicate this under-\\nstanding and with an intention to help. ” The four key terms in this definition are italicized \\nby Hojat and colleagues to underscore their significance in the construct of patient care. \\nSince that time, it has been accepted, almost worldwide, as the definitive definition of \\nthe use of cognitive empathy in health professions. This definition was the result of their \\ndevelopment of the widely used “Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy” [17]. (Note: The \\nname has now been shortened to the “Jefferson Scale of Empathy” (JSE)).\\nBefore Hojat’ s seminal work on empathy, Hogan, in 1969, developed his scale that \\nmeasures the cognitive aspects of empathy [18]. He defined empathy as, “The intellec -\\ntual or imaginative apprehension of another’ s condition or state of mind. ” Even earlier, \\nin 1949, Dymond devised an empathy scale and defined cognitive, role-taking empathy \\nas, “ An empathic person can imaginatively take the role of another and can understand \\nand accurately predict that persons’ thoughts, feelings and actions” [19]. In contrast to \\nscales examining cognitive empathy, or a combination of cognitive and affective empa-\\nthy, in 1996, A. Mehrabian developed the Balanced Emotional Empathy Scale (BEES) \\nthat measures the affective aspect of empathy [20]. He defined emotional, i.e. affective \\nor vicarious empathy, via work by Stotland [21], as, “a vicarious emotional response to \\nthe perceived emotional experiences of others. ” In the context of personality measure-\\nment, it describes individual differences in the tendency to have emotional empathy \\nwith others [20, 22, 23]. Therefore, the BEES measures both components of emotional \\nempathy, i.e. the vicarious experience of others’ feelings as well as the positiveness, \\nadaptability, and affiliative aspects of a person in a balanced way [20].'),\n",

Compassion and sympathy\\n“Compassion” is another word frequently used by health care professionals, \\nand measurement scales have been developed [24]. In this regard, the definition of \\nclinical empathy by Hojat and colleagues encompasses the meaning of compassion. \\nCompassion, which etymologically means “to suffer with” [25], can be defined as, \\n“ A deep awareness of the suffering of another coupled with the wish to relive it. ” and \\nis incorporated within Hojat’ s phrase “ intention to help” [16]. Y et Post and colleagues \\nand others [2, 26] argue that compassionate care is an intensification of the affective \\ndimension of empathy regarding patient suffering. Therefore, it would seem difficult \\nto have compassion for another being that is suffering without having some kind of \\neffect upon the observer of the suffering individual.\\n“Sympathy” is another term frequently used by the general population as well \\nas some health care professionals and social scientists, and scales have been devised \\nto measure it [27]. Decety and Chaminade [28] define sympathy as, “The affinity, \\nassociation, or relationship between persons wherein whatever affects one similarly \\naffects the other. ” Also, sympathy and pity are not the same. Whereas pity is feeling \\nsorry for another, sympathy infers that you have a favorable impression of the other \\nperson. Both pity and sympathy seem to occur among individuals or groups with \\nwhom the observer is familiar, but it is not evoked from others who are not considered \\nas a part of your group or whom you cannot identify with [1]. Studies by Post and \\ncolleagues [2] and Sinclair et\\xa0al. [29] indicate that the use of sympathy by health care \\nworkers or friends of patients invokes a negative emotional reaction from the patient \\nwho discerns a sense of pity or misfortune accompanied by the feeling that they \\nare being treated unfairly. Later in the chapter we’ll see that while some researchers \\nequate affective empathy to sympathy [30], this is not entirely correct. The distinction \\nbetween empathy and sympathy has been described by Hein and Singer as “feel-\\ning as and feeling for the other, ” respectively [31]. Indeed, the development of the \\nAdolescent Measure of Empathy and Sympathy (AMES) by Vossen and colleagues \\n[32] shows that sympathy is more closely related to cognitive empathy vs. affective \\nempathy, and that affective empathy and sympathy appear to be two different emo-\\ntions. Therefore, sympathy, in contrast to compassion, does not necessarily evoke a \\nneed to help another individual in distress.\\nRecall, that the original definition of Einfühlung states that it can be induced \\nby a feeling of awe or joy by viewing something that is esthetically beautiful to the \\nbeholder. This seems distant and somewhat unrelated to how the intertwined terms of \\naffective and cognitive empathy, and sympathy and compassion are used today. This \\nstresses the importance of each researcher to carefully define what they are studying \\nso that equitable comparisons can be made among studies. For additional definitions \\nof empathy, see the thorough review by Cuff and colleagues [3].\\nIn summary, this chapter will use the definitions proposed by Mehrabian [20] for \\naffective empathy, “ A vicarious emotional response to the perceived emotional experi-\\nences of others. ” Cognitive empathy will be used as it relates to health care profes-\\nsionals, so the definition by Hojat and colleagues [16] for what they term as “clinical \\nempathy” will be used: “ A predominantly cognitive (rather than an affective or \\nemotional) attribute that involves an understanding (rather than a feeling) of pain and \\nsuffering of the patient combined with a capacity to communicate this understanding \\nand with an intention to help.”'),\n",

The neural basis of empathy\\nStudies using the JSE [17] to measure cognitive empathy or the BEES [20] to mea-\\nsure affective empathy show sex differences with women having higher JSE or BEES \\nscores than men. For representative studies, see the following references [16, 20, \\n33–37]. These empathic sex differences have a neural basis. Briefly, during the emer-\\ngence of humans, prosocial behavior, including empathy, gave an evolutionary advan-\\ntage to those who possessed this trait. Additionally, paramount in the development \\nof empathy was the ability for humans to distinguish “self” from “other. ” For through \\nreviews on these concepts, see [11, 38, 39]. Commensurate with self-other distinction, \\nthe ability to respond to pain or distress in others evoked the more phylogenetically \\narchaic/emotional brain to provide a “low-road, ” i.e. a bottom-up, vicarious response \\nthat evoked the desire to help the one in distress [10]. This was particularly true in \\nfemales who needed to care for their helpless infants when they were perceived as \\nbeing in distress. Indeed, this affective empathic trait is phylogenetically preserved \\nacross many species of animals because they all possess the archaic neural structures \\nnecessary for an affective emotional response to others in pain [38, 40]. These cortical \\nareas, e.g. the inferior frontal gyrus, insular cortex, and parts of the cingulate gyrus, \\nare known to be cytoarchitecturally more primitive (as defined by Broadmann areas) \\nand are the first to mature in the human cerebral cortex [41]. It is important to note \\nthat an affective empathic response activates what is called the “pain axis” within the \\nCNS [42, 43]. As such, the pain axis utilizes the phylogenetically older regions of the \\nCNS, e.g. the amygdala, anterior insular cortex, and various regions of the cingulate \\ncortex. For a more thorough review , see [44].\\nAfter the development of the low road vicarious empathic response, a “high-road, ” \\ni.e. a top-down empathic response, developed which utilized higher cognitive func-\\ntions, including ToM that is closely related to cognitive empathy [4, 5, 10]. Thus, \\ncognitive empathy uses cortical regions that developed later in primate phylogeny and \\nincludes the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the temporoparietal junction, and the \\nposterior aspect of the superior temporal sulcus [10, 12, 41].\\n5.1 Theory of mind and empathy\\nIn a review by Walter [10], his figure 1 illustrates the CNS components that are \\ninvolved with the “high road” (i.e. top-down, cognitive empathy) and the “low road” \\n(i.e. bottom-up, affective empathy) and how these relate to cognitive ToM; with ToM \\nbeing important in self-other distinction and the ability to represent and understand \\nthe mental states of others [4, 5]. During an empathic response, the affective/vicari-\\nous aspects of empathy arrive in the CNS before cognitive empathy is recruited. \\nIntervening between affective and cognitive empathy is the use of ToM to put a \\nself-other distinction on the experience. In brief, Walter proposes that the “lynch \\npin” between ToM and affective empathy is the use of the ventromedial prefrontal \\ncortex involved with cognitive empathy. Other CNS regions are also implicated, ToM \\nprimarily uses the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (supplemented by the superior \\ntemporal sulcus and the temporoparietal junction), while the affective aspects of \\nempathy utilize the anterior insula and the medial cingulate cortex (supplemented by \\nthe inferior frontal gyrus, amygdala, and the secondary somatosensory cortex). For \\nanother more recent meta-analysis of ToM and empathy, see Schurz et\\xa0al. [5].'),\n",

Several other lesion studies show that the \\nventromedial prefrontal cortex and the right temporal pole are also implicated in  \\nthe affective aspect of empathy. The only region that was exclusive for affective empa-\\nthy was the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex that was implicated in a lesion study [52].\\nThe most frequently activated regions involved with cognitive empathy via meta-\\nanalyses or lesion studies include the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (which may \\noverlap with the medial prefrontal cortex), the posterior superior temporal gyrus, \\nand the temporoparietal junction that is involved with ToM [4]. Regions exclusive for \\ncognitive empathy were those areas involved with ToM, i.e. temporoparietal junction \\nand the posterior superior temporal gyrus. Another potential exclusive region was the \\nposterior cingulate cortex which blends into the precuneus of the parietal lobe [10].\\nWith the above being said, most of the cognitive empathy regions that overlap \\nwith affective empathy areas comes from a meta-analyses study [48] that mentions \\nthe left anterior insular cortex, anterior and middle cingulate cortex, and the supple-\\nmentary motor cortex. Two lesion studies [51, 52] also show overlap via the ventrome-\\ndial prefrontal cortex. A single fMRI study [54] indicates an overlap with the inferior \\nfrontal gyrus.\\nTwo studies [28, 46] examined regions of the CNS activated by sympathy/com-\\npassion using a meta-analyses of fMRI data or PET scans. Although there is overlap \\nwith regions involved with both affective and cognitive empathy, there are also many \\nregions involved with the CNS reward system that are exclusive to sympathy/compas-\\nsion. These reward areas include the ventral tegmental area, the striatum, nucleus \\naccumbens, and the amygdala. Overlap occurs with regions implied for affective \\nempathy via the inferior frontal gyrus, parts of the cingulate cortex, the temporal \\npoles, and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Cognitive empathy and sympathy/\\ncompassion overlap in the temporal poles, the orbitofrontal cortex, and the medial \\nand ventromedial prefrontal cortex.\\nWhen examining affective vs. cognitive empathy vs. sympathy/compassion, there \\nare two regions that seem to be involved in all three; these are the ventromedial pre-\\nfrontal cortex and the temporal poles.

The fMRI study by Singer [12] examined both cognitive and affective empathy, \\nbut the superior temporal pole was only activated via cognitive empathy. The study \\nby Schulte-Rüther and colleagues [54] only examined cognitive empathy. Therefore, \\nthe involvement of the right superior temporal pole with affective empathy must be \\nviewed with caution, since lesion studies can, by nature, involve more areas of the \\ncerebral cortex than the more “focused” studies using fMRI or PET scans. This leaves \\nthe prefrontal cortex, especially the right ventromedial region, as the only area being \\ninvolved in affective and cognitive empathy as well as sympathy/compassion, since it \\nis implicated in lesion studies [51, 52] (both of which used the BEES to show a decline \\nin affective empathy scores due to the lesions), meta-analyses [10, 45], fMRI, and PET \\nscans [28, 55].\\nIn contrast to the above, a robust multi-level kernel density analysis (MKDA) \\nstudy by Fan and colleagues [48] does not include the ventromedial prefrontal cor -\\ntex as a region that is activated by both cognitive and affective empathy. Instead, \\nFigure 3 by Fan et\\xa0al. [48] shows that the left anterior insula was the only region to \\nbe activated by both types of empathy (sympathy/compassion was not examined). \\nThe right anterior insula was activated by affective empathy, while the left anterior  \\nmid-cingulate cortex was activated by cognitive empathy. Other regions that were \\ninvolved with affective empathy (with an uncorrected MDKA threshold) are the \\nright dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, the right dorsomedial thalamic nucleus, \\nand the midbrain (most likely involving the periaqueductal gray). For cognitive \\nempathy, the left medial orbitofrontal cortex and the left dorsomedial thalamic \\nnucleus were involved. Their description of a core empathy network shows how the \\nexteroceptive (affective) as well as the interoceptive (cognitve) aspects of empathy \\nare interrelated [48]. The bottom-up, affective empathy areas use CNS networks \\nthat are involved with more primitive CNS regions involved with pain, disgust, \\nand fear, whereas the cognitive aspects of empathy are using phylogenetically and \\ncytoarchitecturally more recently developed CNS regions for a top-down empathic \\nresponse.\\nIn summary, mapping the CNS regions used by affective and cognitive empathy \\nand sympathy/compassion is much like a Venn diagram with many sites poten -\\ntially overlapping for all three emotions. Y et, each of these emotions have distinct \\nregions that are reported to be activated using a variety of techniques, including \\nlesion studies. Affective empathy activates the anterior insular cortex, the anterior \\nand medial cingulate cortex, and the inferior frontal gyrus. Cognitive empathy, \\nwhich uses areas involved with ToM, activates the ventromedial prefrontal cor -\\ntex, the superior temporal cortex, the temporoparietal junction, and the medial \\nprefrontal cortex. Sympathy/compassion is associated with the reward system and \\nactivates the ventral tegmental area, the striatum, amygdala, nucleus accumbens, \\nand the medial orbitofrontal cortex. In many studies, it appears that the ventrome -\\ndial prefrontal cortex is involved in all three emotions, and as Walter [10] sug -\\ngests, it may be the common denominator among these emotions. In an imagined \\nsituation where a person is exposed to an emotionally charged setting, e.g. caring \\nfor a severely injured person in the Emergency Department, affective empathic \\nresponses enter the CNS of the health care provider first, these are modified by \\nhigher cortical regions involved with ToM, and then a cognitive empathic response \\nis elicited.'),\n",

Varied other factors can influence empathy\\nStudies have shown that many things can modify the empathy of an individual. \\nAlthough an in-depth discussion of these factors is beyond the scope of this chapter, \\nsome of these can be briefly mentioned. Reviewed in a previous work [44] is how \\nvarious CNS regions, especially those involved with the pain axis, are anatomically \\ndifferent between the sexes. In addition to anatomical sexual dimorphism, there \\nis a sexually dimorphic recruitment of empathy-related cortical areas within the \\nCNS, e.g. the amygdala, superior temporal sulcus, temporoparietal junction, and \\nthe inferior frontal gyrus [54, 57]. Walter [10] and others [58, 59] discuss the genetic \\naspects of empathy, especially in regard to the phylogenetically ancient hormones/\\nneurotransmitters oxytocin and vasopressin, as well as reviewing how various genes \\nand the environment may be implicated in empathic responses. Derntl et\\xa0al. [60] \\nreveal how trait empathy changes with the menstrual cycle; and another study shows \\nhow gonadal hormones influence empathy [61]. Schulte-Rüther et\\xa0al. also show sex \\ndifferences in how empathy is processed [62].\\nA study by Thirioux and colleagues [63] shows the time course of how various \\nhigher CNS regions are recruited in relation to cognitive empathy and sympathy, \\nand how they relate to the mirror neuron system and the mentalizing/ToM network. \\nOther studies show that as children develop, there are changes in which regions are \\nused for cognitive and affective empathy as well as how strongly they are activated. In \\nbrief, younger-aged people use a more bottom-up response to an emotionally charged \\nsituation, and as they age, a more top-down approach is utilized as the cerebral \\ncortex, especially the prefrontal cortex, matures after the teenage years [64, 65]. In a \\nchapter by Newton [44], studies are reviewed that show how physicians empathically \\nrespond to noncompliant patients and to patients who are disparate from themselves. \\nFinally, even an over-the-counter drug as ubiquitous as acetaminophen can reduce a \\nperson’ s affective empathy for seeing another person in physical or social pain [66].\\n7.  Affective and cognitive empathy among allopathic and osteopathic \\nmedical students\\nNewton [35] and Newton and colleagues [34, 67, 68] have performed a series of \\nlongitudinal studies examining how cognitive and/or affective empathy changes as \\nallopathic or osteopathic medical students go through their 4\\xa0years of undergraduate \\nmedical education. These studies used the BEES and the JSE surveys to determine \\naffective and cognitive empathy scores, respectively [17, 20]. These data were then \\ncompared to a population norm established by Mehrabian [20] and verified by \\nNewton et\\xa0al. [34], or to a recently published nationwide norm of osteopathic medi-\\ncal students in the US [33]. The longitudinal studies by Newton and colleagues also \\nexamined the residency specialty the students desired as they went through their \\n4\\xa0years of training, as well as their residency choice for their first postgraduate year \\nafter obtaining their medical degree.\\nThe longitudinal empathy study performed at an allopathic school (University \\nof Arkansas for Medical Science (UAMS)) showed that affective empathy, i.e. BEES \\nscores, significantly dropped after the completion of the first year of basic science \\ncourses, as well as, unexpectedly, significantly dropping after the completion of their \\nfirst year of clinical rotations [34, 69]. BEES scores did not significantly change after'),\n",

It was proposed this was most \\nlikely due to the students knowing they passed the first year, so there was a probable \\ndecrease in anxiety and/or they had refined their study techniques.\\nThese data also confirmed the sexually dimorphic aspect of affective empathy \\nwith BEES scores of women being significantly higher than male scores [20, 34, 68]. \\nRegarding desired specialty choice while in medical school, 23 residency specialties were \\nsegregated by Newton and colleagues [69] into “Core” and “Non-Core” groups. Core \\nspecialties are those that are generally considered as primary care specialties, i.e. those \\nwith a large amount of patient contact and continuity of care. The Core specialties are \\nfamily medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, Ob/Gyn, and psychiatry. Eighteen Non-\\nCore specialties are more procedure or technically-oriented and have little or no patient \\ncontact or continuity of care, e.g. diagnostic radiology, emergency medicine, anesthe-\\nsiology, or any of the surgical specialties. Men or women who desired to enter the Core \\nspecialties were better able to maintain their BEES scores vs. those allopathic students \\nwho desired Non-Core specialties [69]. Women who desired the Non-Core specialties \\nhad a 17.3% drop in BEES scores after completing their first year of clinical rotations, \\nwith some of them having BEES scores which approached the male norm. The greatest \\n4-year decline was for men in Non-Core specialties (38.7%) with women BEES scores \\nin Non-Core specialties dropping by 29.3% over their 4\\xa0years of undergraduate medical \\ntraining. Women desiring Core specialties had the smallest 4-year decline in BEES scores \\n(13.0%), suggesting they were better able to maintain their affective empathy. (Note: \\nonly affective empathy was studied at UAMS since the JSE had not yet been developed).\\nSince the development of the JSE in 2001 [17], Newton and Vaskalis [67, 68] have \\ncompleted data collection for another 7-year longitudinal empathy study examining \\nboth affective and cognitive empathy in osteopathic medical students at the Campbell \\nUniversity Jerry M. Wallace School of Osteopathic Medicine (CUSOM). These data have \\nbeen presented in abstract form at the International Association of Medical Science \\nEducators (IAMSE) annual meeting in 2015–2018 and 2022. [67,\\xa068,\\xa070]. (Manuscripts \\nin preparation.) One of the main hypotheses of the CUSOM longitudinal study was \\nto determine if osteopathic education, with its strong emphasis on the osteopathic \\nphilosophy of “mind, body and spirit” [71], combined with an emphasis on effective \\npatient-physician communication skills, would result in a moderation of the drop in \\nBEES scores with commensurate increases in JSE scores. Importantly, it is now pos -\\nsible to compare the CUSOM JSE data to students at other osteopathic schools since the \\npublication of the ongoing nationwide Project on Osteopathic Medical Education and \\nEmpathy (POMEE) study data by Hojat and colleagues [33].\\nThe osteopathic data from the Newton and Vaskalis studies [67, 68, 70] follow the \\nsame trends as what Newton and colleagues found with the allopathic students [34, 69]. \\nWomen have higher BEES and JSE scores than men, women entering into Core special -\\nties better maintain their BEES and JSE scores than women who enter the Non-Core \\nspecialties, and male BEES and JSE scores tend to have larger drops in scores than those \\nseen in women. Once again, the largest drops in BEES and JSE scores occurred after the \\ncompletion of the first basic science year and the completion of the first clinical rotation \\nyear. The timing of the drops in CUSOM JSE scores closely match the reductions seen in \\nJSE scores at other allopathic and osteopathic medical schools, e.g. see [72–75].\\n7.1 BEES and JSE scores vs. residency specialty match\\nThe UAMS Longitudinal Empathy Study showed the different residencies selected \\nby allopathic graduates as determined by their BEES scores [76].

(Eight additional specialties were not selected by enough \\nstudents to establish statistical power.) The BEES scores of the male or female stu-\\ndents who entered into the Core residencies placed the five Core residencies in the t op \\nsix positions. In descending order, they were Ob/Gyn, pediatrics, psychiatry, family \\nmedicine, and internal medicine. Anesthesiology was in the fifth position out of the \\n15 residencies selected. All of the BEES scores for the Core specialties were designated \\nby Mehrabian [20] as “ Average” (50th percentile) when compared to the population \\nnorm. (See table 1 for the Mehrabian designations in [35].) At the bottom of the 15 \\nspecialties were those male or female students who selected pathology or orthopedic \\nsurgery. Both specialties were ranked at the 16th percentile when compared to a \\nnormal population and had “Moderately Low” BEES scores. These data indicate that \\nstudents with higher BEES scores preferentially entered the Core specialties that have \\nconsiderable patient contact and continuity of care. Conversely, those students with \\nlower BEES scores tended to enter the more technically oriented, Non-Core specialties \\nwith little or no patient contact or continuity of care.\\nBEES scores for osteopathic residency choice [35] resemble what was found in \\nthe allopathic study [76]. In the osteopathic longitudinal study, only 11 of the pos-\\nsible 23 residency specialties were selected by eight or more students. The top four \\npositions, in descending order, were occupied by the Core specialties of pediatrics, \\nfamily medicine, internal medicine, and Ob/Gyn. All of these were designated as \\n“ Average” according to Mehrabian [20], with the exception of men entering pediatrics \\nwhere their combined BEES score was ranked at the 69th percentile and designated \\nas “Slightly High. ” In contrast to the allopathic data, psychiatry was eighth out of 11 \\nslots and was designated as “Slightly Low” (31st percentile). The bottom two rankings \\nwere for anesthesiology and diagnostic radiology, both at the 16th percentile and had \\n“Moderately Low” BEES scores. It is currently unknown why the BEES scores for \\nallopathic students entering into anesthesiology placed the specialty in the fifth slot \\n(out of 15) vs. the BEES scores for the osteopathic students that placed anesthesiol-\\nogy in the 10th slot out of the 11 possible selections. This was the largest discrepancy \\nfound for residency choice between the allopathic vs. the osteopathic graduates.\\nJSE scores were slightly different for those residency specialties entered by the \\nosteopathic graduates [35]. The five Core specialties were in the top 6/11 positions: \\nIn descending order, they were pediatrics, family medicine, Ob/Gyn, psychiatry, \\nand internal medicine. Orthopedics (only selected by men) and anesthesiology were \\nthe bottom two positions. What is concerning is that when compared to the POMEE \\nnorms for third- and fourth-year osteopathic students [33], only women CUSOM \\ngraduates who entered into psychiatry had a percentile score that was above the \\n50th percentile (59th); all other percentiles for the men and women in Core special-\\nties were between the 29–44th percentiles. Percentile JSE scores for the bottom two \\nselected specialties were even lower and were between 12th and 21st percentiles. So, \\noverall, only 10 women out of a cohort of 345 CUSOM graduates had JSE scores that \\nwere above the 50th percentile when compared to the POMEE norm.\\n8.

Y et, over blunting affective \\nempathy can lead to the development of a health professional who has inadequate social \\nskills and will appear and act in a distant, detached manner from the patient. In this \\nregard, it has been shown that establishing an empathic bond of trust with patients leads \\nto a lower incidence of malpractice suits, increased patient compliance, and better health \\noutcomes [77–81]. Ergo, the converse would be detrimental to patient satisfaction and \\ncompliance. Therefore, being able to adequately quell the affective response allows the \\nhealth care provider to respond in a calm, reassuring fashion to the patient by using ToM \\nand cognitive empathy, thereby establishing a bond of trust with the patient.\\nIn reference to the above, a further analysis of the data from the CUSOM longitudi -\\nnal study plotted BEES scores vs. JSE scores [70]. Scatter plots were used ( Figure 1)  \\nto determine which students raised or maintained their cognitive empathy, via JSE \\nscores, while decreasing their BEES (Those points enclosed in the box). JSE scores had \\nto be at or above the 75th percentile for the CUSOM cohort, while BEES scores had \\nto decrease by −0.50 to −1.49\\xa0s.d. off the population norm established by Mehrabian \\n[20]. BEES scores in this range would be considered as “Slightly Low” to “Moderately \\nLow” . Decreasing BEES scores by ≥ −1.5\\xa0s.d. would place those students in the “Very \\nLow” (7th percentile) to “Very Extremely Low” (0.6th percentile) portion of the \\npopulation. These latter students would correspond to the scatter plot points to the far \\nleft and lower left in Figure 1. The BEES scores between −25 and\\xa0−\\xa075 suggest these \\nindividuals would have a very low affective response and may be perceived by patients \\nas a callous, indifferent health care provider. In a similar fashion, those individuals who \\nhave BEES scores >80, i.e. ≥ +1.5\\xa0s.d., (top 7% of a normal population) may have an \\naffective response that is too great and result in ineffective patient care. These students \\nare represented by the upper right data points in Figure 1.

Furthermore, when examining the \\ndata from the first year through the end of the fourth year, 32 students qualified at \\nonly one of the five data collection time points, eight at two time points, and only \\none person qualified for four of the possible five time points. Out of the 41 qualify-\\ning osteopathic students, 24 entered Core residencies, while 17 selected Non-Core \\nresidencies. These data are disturbing in that the efforts to teach effective commu-\\nnication skills, via standardized patient encounters, osteopathic manipulation labs, \\nmock mass-casualty incidents, and didactic sessions dealing with subjects such as \\nend-of-life, giving bad news, spirituality, or even a session on empathy, did not have a \\nsubstantial impact on the student empathy scores.\\n9. Empathy and burnout\\nIt is possible that the large number of CUSOM students who have high BEES \\nscores put themselves at risk of burnout, since it takes considerable cognitive effort \\nto control affective empathic responses [82–84]. Many of the students/graduates with \\nhigher BEES and JSE scores prefer to enter into the Core, people-oriented, specialties \\n[35, 76, 85]. Thus, having an increased amount of affective and cognitive empathy \\ntakes a toll on the health care provider, especially women, who have a greater rate \\nof burnout than men [86–88]. Many women osteopathic graduates prefer to enter \\nthe Core specialties, especially pediatrics, Ob/Gyn, and family medicine at a rate of \\nalmost twice that of men [35, 85]. For the allopathic students at UAMS, only pediat-\\nrics and Ob/Gyn were predominated by women, once again at an almost 2:1 margin. \\nAny allopathic or osteopathic student with blunted BEES scores may be better able \\nto perform in the Non-Core, technical, or procedure-oriented specialties without \\nan increased rate of burnout, with the caveat of not becoming too hardened. As an \\nexample, it has been shown that physicians who, by necessity, induce pain in their \\npatients during a procedure blunt their affective response to the pain they are causing \\nin their patients [89, 90]. This allows them to concentrate on the patient vs. thinking \\nabout the pain they are causing. For a more detailed discussion, see [44].\\n10. Conclusions\\nThis chapter points out that over the years, there have been many definitions of \\nempathy, and some of them incorporate sympathy or compassion into the definitions. \\nOver the past few decades, there has been a consensus there are two basic types of \\nempathy: an affective or vicarious empathy and a cognitive or role-taking empathy. \\nEach of these two types of empathy employ some unique CNS regions which makes \\neach type distinct. However, like a Venn diagram, there is overlap in many of the \\nregions, and this may be due to the type of imaging being used, e.g. fMRI, PET scans, \\ntranscranial magnetic stimulation, and/or the empathy- or sympathy-inducing \\nscenarios being used by the investigators. Other studies have used patients with vari-\\nous CNS lesions to determine regions used by empathy. Although some authors feel \\nthat sympathy/compassion is the same as affective empathy, various studies show that'),\n",

Consequently, this author feels that sympathy is not the same \\nemotion as vicarious/affective empathy. One region that was recruited by both affec-\\ntive and cognitive empathy, as well as sympathy/compassion, was the ventromedial \\nprefrontal cortex. Thus, this region may be a key moderator of emotional responses.\\nVirtually, all studies show that women have significantly higher affective (BEES) \\nand cognitive (JSE) empathy scores. Longitudinal studies by the author and col-\\nleagues at an allopathic and osteopathic medical school indicate that both affective \\nand cognitive empathy drops after the completion of the first basic science year of \\nstudy and after the first clinical rotation year. These studies also show that those stu-\\ndents with higher BEES and/or JSE scores preferentially enter into the Core, people-\\noriented, specialties (i.e. family and internal medicine, pediatrics, Ob/Gyn, and \\npsychiatry), while those students with lower empathy scores tend to gravitate toward \\nthe Non-Core, technical or procedure-oriented, specialties, e.g. diagnostic radiology, \\nemergency medicine, anesthesiology, and surgical specialties.\\nFinally, the osteopathic longitudinal empathy study shows that educational efforts \\nto boost effective communication skills and to partially blunt affective empathy are cur -\\nrently inadequate [70]. However, several other researchers are attempting to enhance \\ncognitive empathic communication skills [91–94] to increase patient satisfaction and \\ncompliance [95]; while others ask for additional neuroscience studies to help improve \\nmedical student empathy [96, 97]. Nevertheless, medical students or recent grad uates \\nwho have high BEES and JSE scores may be at risk for increased rates of burnout, espe -\\ncially women.

Thanks to its features of embodied technology, VR \\ncan let users virtually walk in someone else’ s shoes. In addition, multi-sensory VR \\nexperiences can present evocative and heart-wrenching stimuli. For these reasons, \\nVR seems to be a likely candidate to foster empathy. However, the published literature \\nindicates that the impact of VR on empathy is complex and depends both on the type \\nof VR and also the type of empathy being evaluated. The present chapter compares \\ntwo meta-analyses which suggest that VR can elicit empathy, but the theoretical \\nfactors on which the technology has more efficacies are in contrast. In this chapter, \\nthese discordant meta-analyses are discussed, and the reasons why they find different \\nresults are theorized. We attempt to answer when and how VR could be an empathy \\nmachine. We conclude that low-tech but evocative storytelling is most likely to yield \\nemotional empathy, and embodied experiences that encourage perspective-taking \\nwill improve cognitive empathy. Although we attempt to present the latest empirical \\nevidence about empathy and VR, we are aware that the scientific consensus around \\nthis topic is likely to evolve in the future.\\nKeywords: empathy, virtual reality, meta-analysis review , body cognition\\n1. Introduction\\nEmpathy plays a key role in preserving human social relationships. Empathic \\npeople are more likely to engage in prosocial behavior, and less likely to engage in \\naggressive behaviors. Moreover, even temporary arousal of empathy can have positive \\nimpacts on behavior in the moment [1, 2]. Empathy is composed of both emotional \\nand cognitive factors whose integration contributes to share and understand another \\nperson’ s perspective. Importantly, scholars have described empathy as a muscle, and \\nas such it should be capable of growth and even regeneration with sufficient effort \\n[3]. Following this logic, a variety of empathy training programs have been designed \\nto explicitly teach empathy (e.g., [3]), and in fields such as medicine, where such \\nprograms are used regularly, they generally have sizable positive effects (g\\xa0=\\xa00.63, \\n[4] for meta-analysis). These programs are generally based on taking the perspec-\\ntive of someone else with the aim to feel the others emotions, to understand them, \\nand to regulate one’ s own feelings [5]. Y et as most people are unlikely to enroll in \\nexplicit empathy training without incentive, psychologists have begun to explore how'),\n",

Recent research has shown that \\nwritten fiction [6], drama [7], and of course virtual reality [8, 9] show promise as \\nempathy generators.\\nThe most ardent supporters of Virtual reality (VR) claim it is “the ultimate \\nempathy machine” [10]. In brief, VR is an advanced technology that allow users to be \\npresent and to interact with a three-dimensional environment [11]. There are a wide \\nvariety of VR experiences with different degrees of interaction currently available \\nthat are designed to promote social good. For example, 1000 Cut Journey allows \\nviewers to become Michael Sterling, a Black man, and encounter racism as they try to \\ncomplete everyday activities [12]. Users can interact with the experience by opening \\ndoors and picking-up objects using a controller. Other experiences, such as Clouds \\nover Sidra, are less interactive but immerse the user in 360-video as they follow a \\nday in the life of 12-year-old Sidra who lives in a refugee camp [13]. New VR experi-\\nences continue to be created by innovative designers the world over. In 2016, VR \\ngiant Oculus released their “VR for Good” initiative to incentivize designers to create \\nprosocial content [14]. Not to be outdone by their leading competitor, HTC VIVE \\nannounced their $10 million “VR for Impact” program in 2017 [15]. VR has also been \\nembraced by various charitable organizations as part of their fundraising campaigns \\n(e.g., [13, 16–18]).\\n2. Conflicting literature on VR and empathy\\nDespite its popularity, experimental evidence for the empathy-building efficacy \\nof VR generally, and 360-degree video specifically, is inconsistent. For example, \\nalthough some VR experiences have led to increases in empathy [8, 19, 20], these \\npositive effects do always exceed more traditional and low cost experiences, such as \\nreading [9], asking people to imagine what it would be like to be in someone else’ s \\nsituation [21] or taking part in real world role play [22].\\nThese conflicting results from individual research studies are compounded by two \\nrecent conflicting meta-analyses authored by ourselves. Meta-analyses normally serve \\nto reduce confusion by reducing the impact of random errors and providing a more \\nprecise estimate of the average effect size. They even allow researchers to explor e \\npotential moderators that may explain why a result is true in some cases but not in \\nothers. However, for VR and empathy, even using meta-analysis we did not find a \\nconsensus. Using data from 43 studies Martingano et al. found that VR led to approxi-\\nmately a third of a standard deviation more emotional empathy (d\\xa0=\\xa00.325) but no \\nsignificant increase in cognitive empathy [23]. However, using a more constrained \\ndefinition of VR, Ventura et al. found that in 7 studies VR led to approximately half \\na standard deviation more cognitive empathy (d\\xa0=\\xa00.513) but had no significant \\neffect on emotional empathy [24] the reversed results (see Figure 1). The reason, we \\nargue, is because the impact of VR on empathy depends not just on one thing, but two \\ninteracting moderators, namely, the type of empathy and the type of VR.\\n2.1 The impact of Virtual Reality depends upon the type of empathy\\nScholars and laypeople alike hold a variety of diverse and competing defini -\\ntions of empathy [25]. In an influential paper on the topic, Daniel Batson listed \\neight definitions of empathy with the hope of reducing confusion by recognizing \\nthe term’ s complexity [26]. One of the reasons it is so difficult to define empathy'),\n",

It is not simply that researchers have not \\nagreed on a single definition of empathy, but that empathy is not a single thing to \\nbegin with.\\nAlthough there is disagreement in the literature regarding exactly what counts \\nas empathy, many scholars make a distinction between cognitive and emotional \\nempathy. Emotional empathy (sometimes called affective empathy) involves \\nexperiencing emotions in response to others’ emotions or expressions of emotions. \\nOn the other hand, cognitive empathy involves understanding others’ thoughts \\nand feelings without necessarily reacting emotionally [2]. This understanding is \\nmost often achieved via perspective-taking, so much so that perspective-taking is \\noften used as a synonym for cognitive empathy. Given the definitional confusion \\nsurrounding the term empathy, in this chapter, we will discuss research and theory \\non empathy that is styled under many different names. Overall, cognitive and \\nemotional empathy are best thought of as broad categories that each encompass a \\nvariety of different empathy types. Despite disagreement over which concepts are \\nclassified under each category, the distinction between emotional and cognitive \\nempathy remains common [26, 27].\\nDespite our conflicting results, Martingano et al. [23] and Ventura et al. [24] \\nboth find the distinction between cognitive and emotional empathy is critical when \\ndiscussing the impact of VR on empathy.\\nSo why might VR impact emotional and cognitive empathy differently? Media \\nscholars have argued that one of the strengths of VR is that it removes the cognitive \\nburden normally associated with empathizing [28]. By virtually taking someone else’ s \\nperspective on behalf of users, VR is doing the work of cognitive empathy for them. \\nVR designers have made use of powerful graphics, motion-sensing technologies, and \\nsurround sound systems to place viewers in realistic environments and situations \\nthat they might find hard to imagine, such as refugee camps, homeless shelters, or \\nthe experience of racial discrimination. By doing the perspective-taking on behalf \\nof users, it is hoped that VR can enhance empathy in people who are not otherwise \\nmotivated or able to empathize [29].\\nFigure 1. \\nO verall standardized mean differences and 95% confidence intervals for published meta-analyses on the impact of \\nVR on empathy.'),\n",

Cognitive load hinders both emotion recognition [28, 30] and \\nperspective-taking [31]. Moreover, neuroscientists have shown that the more difficult \\nit is to predict another person’ s intentions, the more active the brain areas involved \\nin cognitive empathy become. Therefore, it seems likely that cognitive empathy, like \\nmany other skills, benefits from the practice and that practice should occur within \\nthe zone of proximal development [32]. The zone of proximal development is defined \\nas the space between what someone can do without assistance and what they can do \\nwith assistance. In other words, optimal skill development occurs a practice activity \\nis not too difficult, but also not too easy. Practice activities known to enhance cogni-\\ntive empathy include acting and creative writing, which require some little effort to \\nrecreate the mental states of fictional characters [33, 34]. The question is, does VR \\nprovide a suitable opportunity for users to practice cognitive empathy skills? In some \\ncases, VR may be making it too easy for users by doing the perspective-taking work \\nfor them, alternatively, VR may overwhelm the senses making it too difficult for users \\nto focus on understanding others’ emotions. But importantly, in some cases, VR may \\nprovide the optimum level of support needed for users to practice and improve their \\nperspective-taking, emotion recognition, and other cognitive empathy skills. We will \\ndiscuss what features were used in the 7 studies included in Ventura and colleagues \\n[24] meta-analysis that seemed to make them so effective at enhancing cognitive \\nempathy in the next section and why the majority of studies included in Martingano \\nand colleagues [23] meta-analysis were not, but first we ought to consider why VR \\nmight increase emotional empathy.\\nThe idea that virtually taking another person’ s perspective would lead to emo-\\ntional empathy is rooted in a long-standing assumption that perspective-taking is the \\nmechanism by which emotional empathy occurs. This idea was borne from extensive \\nresearch showing that if you ask someone to take someone else’ s perspective, they are \\nmore likely to feel emotional empathy towards them (e.g. [35]). However, research-\\ners now know that people default to feeling emotional empathy for others who are \\nsuffering regardless of whether perspective taking instructions are given, and the \\napparent benefit of perspective-taking was actually from a dampening effect of \\ncontrol instructions [36, 37]. Indeed, neuroscientific evidence shows us that per-\\nspective-taking is not a required pathway to emotional empathy. Emotional empathic \\nresponses are fast, automatic, and occur spontaneously [38] even when participants \\nare not consciously aware of what they are seeing [39]. In our daily lives, most of us \\nare familiar with automatic emotional empathy, it’ s the sort that rushes over us when a \\nrefugee child is depicted on the news. VR may well arouse emotional empathy auto-\\nmatically if it depicts the suffering of another person, but this is unlikely to be due \\nto the virtual perspective-taking feature and simply a result of displaying evocative \\nstimuli. The differing results of our two meta-analyses found for emotional empathy, \\ntherefore, are likely due to the different emotionally arousing nature of the VR experi-\\nences included in each meta-analysis (see below).\\n2.2 The impact on empathy depends on the type of virtual reality\\nVR is an overarching term for a collection of computer hardware and software \\nthat immerses users in artificial environments. Both the hardware and the virtual \\ncontent may impact whether a given VR experience is effective at arousing empathy. \\nCommonly, VR experiences use a headset to display three-dimensional images and \\nwhile wearing this system, a user’ s movements and orientation are tracked and fed'),\n",

However, \\nother hardware has been considered under the umbrella ‘virtual reality’ . Martingano \\net al. used a particularly all-encompassing definition of virtual reality that included \\n“any computer technology that virtually simulates one or more senses (auditory, \\nvisual, olfactory, gustatory, and/or tactile simulations)” . Within this definition \\ndesktop VR that plays on a normal computer screen is included as it stimulates vision \\nand auditory senses, and so too are auditory-only simulations played on regular \\nheadphones (for example simulations of what it may be like to suffer from auditory \\nhallucinations as a result of schizophrenia).\\nIn contrast, the VR experiences included in Ventura et al. ’ s meta-analysis all used \\nhead-mounted display units making these experiences more immersive on average, \\nbenefiting from spatialized sound, stereoscopic visuals, greater image resolution, and \\na higher update rate. More immersive VR environments have been associated with \\ncreating a heightened feeling of presence in users [40]. Presence is the “perceptual \\nillusion of non-mediation” [41], where a user fails to acknowledge the existence of \\nthe VR environment and responds as it were not there. More simply put, the user has \\na feeling of truly “being there” in the virtual environment [28]. Recent research sug-\\ngests that the feeling of presence mediates the influence of VR on empathy [42]. This \\nmay be one reason why Ventura and colleagues found an overall positive impact of VR \\non cognitive empathy, but Martingano and colleagues did not.\\nIn addition, to creating a sense of presence, immersive VR can also create feelings \\nof embodiment. Developments in motion and voice detection have led to a tighter \\ncoupling of body and machine which may trigger feelings of body ownership in users \\n[43]. VR allows users to see and hear as if they were experiencing someone else’ s point \\nof view in the real world, in other words, to have an “embodied experience” [28]. In \\nsome cases, a VR experience is specifically designed to produce a “body ownership \\nillusion” or “body-swap illusion” where users are deliberately given a virtual body \\nthat is different from their own. In Ventura’ s meta-analysis, 3 of the 7 studies used \\na body swap illusion (42.9%). However, in Martingano’ s meta-analysis only 7 of 43 \\nstudies (16.3%) used this illusion. Body swap illusions may be particularly effective at \\nencouraging users to take the perspective of the person they are embodying [44], and \\nprovides another potential explanation for why Ventura found a positive impact on \\ncognitive empathy. The utility of these illusions will be discussed more below .\\n3. When and how VR can increase empathy\\n3.1 Change the body to change the mind: the key role of body ownership\\nEmbodied technology may be a key feature of VR that allows users to practice and \\nimprove their cognitive empathy skills. The sense of embodiment refers to the set of \\nsensations related to having (ownership), being located in (location), and controlling \\n(agency) a body [45]. The body contributes to the representation of ourself and, as \\nexplain by the author Blanke [46], human adults experience a ‘real me’ that ‘resides’ \\nin ‘my’ body and is the subject (or ‘I’) of experience and thought. The multisensory \\nbodily signals and their integrated neural representation are of fundamental impor-\\ntance for self-consciousness and the body is also central to our understanding of oth-\\ners. In general, we become aware of our bodies through exteroceptive signals such as \\nthe touch, and through interoceptive such as the heart rate and proprioceptive signals \\narising from within the body [47]. Then, we use the feelings from the body to sense'),\n",

The perception of our body can be \\nmanipulated generating what is called the “body ownership illusion” or “body-swap \\nillusion” . The usual example is the rubber-hand illusion, during which synchronous \\nstroking of a seen fake rubber hand and one’ s own unseen hand causes the rubber \\nhand to be attributed to one’ s body [46]. The successful manipulations demonstrated \\nthe malleability of the mental representation of one’ s body, identity, and the emotions \\nwe feel.\\nIn the past decades, several studies have demonstrated the ability of VR to induce \\nbody-swap illusions by altering the sense of embodiment. Through the advanced VR \\ntechnologies such as the opt-track suit it is possible to alter the neuropsychological \\nbasis of self-experience and experiment a different “ontological self” by owning a vir-\\ntual body of different race, size, and gender groups. According to Riva [48] there are \\nthree possible strategies that can be used to alter bodily self-consciousness using VR: \\n(i) mindful embodiment, which consists in the modification of the bodily experience \\nby facilitating the availability of its content in the working memory; (ii) augmented \\nembodiment, which is based on the enhancement of bodily self-consciousness by \\naltering/extending its boundaries; and (iii) synthetic embodiment, which aims to \\nreplace own body with synthetic self-consciousness (incarnation). Thanks to these \\ncharacteristics, VR could facilitate cognitive empathy, specifically perspective taking, \\nin challenging situations by offering compelling experience of what it feels like to \\nwalk in someone else’ s shoes [28].\\n3.2  Evocative stimuli to arouse emotions: creating a transformative emotional \\nexperience\\nMany charitable organizations and philanthropic groups interested in using VR \\nto increase empathy are largely turning to cheaper and less technological advanced \\nVR experiences (that are not capable of producing the body-swap illusion) such as \\n360-degree video [13–15]. This choice is likely financially driven: 360-degree videos \\nare much less expensive than computer generated environments, possibly costing as \\nlow as $10\\xa0k/minute to create, whereas the same computer generated (CG) environ-\\nment could cost nearly double that [49]. However, importantly, these experiences \\nmay be sufficient for their purposes of arousing emotional empathy and creating a \\ntransformative emotional experience.\\nA transformative experience is defined as an event in which a person’ s worldview \\nis reconstructed, resulting in a shifted perspective of the world, or in the change on \\nvalues and beliefs [50]. The transformative experiences induced in VR could facilitate \\nsocial interaction by helping people to establish common ground and infer shared \\nknowledge and beliefs between interactants [51]. Potentially even low-tech VR can \\ngenerate high sense of engagement and social connectedness in people that naturally \\nbelong to the outgroup and therefore increase emotional empathy [23].\\nTo do this, VR technology can be used to show emotionally evocative imagery. \\nParticularly of children, animals, or other targets whom users can relate to, engage \\nwith, and feel connected to. This can be achieved by showing real-world footage of \\nsuffering individuals, with close-ups of emotion-laden faces, crescendo-ing music, \\nand an invested narrator. A good example of this is, ‘Clouds over Sidra’ , which is a \\ndocumentary-style 360-video of a refugee camp depicting a young girl called Sidra \\nwho talks about her life in the camp and hopes for the future [13]. Another example \\nis a 360-video showing female sexual harassment that has been shown to increase \\nemotional empathy in a male sample ( Figure 2) [52].'),\n",

Social scientists have tested the effec-\\ntiveness of such individuated appeals experimentally, with the phenomena earning \\nitself the name The Identifiable Victim Effect. Identified victims have been found to \\nevoke stronger feelings of empathic compassion than statistical victims [53] and this \\nincreased arousal mediates increased charitable giving [54]. In an important recent \\nresearch study [55] demonstrated that regardless of the technology used, telling \\nengaging narratives is key to the success of VR. This study helps to explain why \\nmore immersive VR experiences do not necessarily lead to more emotional empathy. \\nPeople can engage in a narrative without surround sound or high-resolution graph -\\nics. In the same way a low-budget play can still transport us to another world, and \\na novel can lead us into another’ s psyche, a cardboard VR headset playing the right \\ncontent can also generate emotional empathy. Understanding that narrative engage -\\nment is key to enhancing emotional empathy with VR also helps to explain why in \\nsome cases VR is not outperforming more low-tech solutions such as reading or \\nwatching a video [23].\\n4. Discussion\\nScience grows continuously: answers provided by previous research leads to \\nnew research questions, and so on. The present chapter represents another turn in \\nthis cycle, as we attempt to understand when and how VR increases empathy. Our \\ndiscussion arises from two published meta-analysis authored by ourself that present \\ncontrasting findings on which empathy factors are better fostered by VR: emotional \\nempathy in Martingano and colleagues [23], and cognitive empathy in Ventura \\nand colleagues [24]. We conclude that our results are a product of two interacting \\nmoderators: the type of empathy and the type of VR in question. Emotional empathy \\nappears to be aroused most effectively by evocative stimuli and immersive storytell-\\ning, whereas cognitive empathy appears to benefit from embodied experiences which \\nrequire more technological advanced VR experiences.\\nFigure 2. \\nA participant watching the 360-degree video about sexual harassment into the female perspective.'),\n",

First of all, like all meta-analyses, the quality and precision of our estimated \\neffects was dictated by the nature of the studies available for inclusion. Although we \\nfeel it is unlikely, it is possible that the different results obtained in Martingano and \\ncolleagues and Ventura and colleagues are simply statistical artifacts. As can be seen \\nfrom Figure 1, the 95% confidence intervals from both meta-analyses overlap, and \\nso it is possible that the true size of this effect is captured within these bounds. More \\nresearch, as always, would help tighten these estimations and we encourage other \\nresearchers to update our work as appropriate.\\nSecond, content matters. In much the same way that not all television shows have \\nthe same effect, not all VR experiences do. Some television shows are educational, \\nsome are funny, and some are unsuitable for minors. Therefore, in the same way it is \\nfoolish to ask whether TV in general is educational, it is also mistaken to ask whether \\nVR in general increases empathy. Although neither of our meta-analyses deliberately \\nselected for content, both were restricted to VR experiences that had content that \\nwas more likely to elicit empathy because articles had to measure empathy to be \\nincluded. Researchers who had gone to the effort to measure empathy generally did so \\nbecause they expected their VR experience would impact it. It is not very likely that \\nresearchers are going to put users in a first-person shooter VR game and then measure \\nempathy – at least we have not seen that done! Psychological research finds that the \\ntype of media content matters for whether outcomes are aggressive or prosocial [56]. \\nSimilarly, violent VR content is unlikely to have a positive effect on empathy and may \\neven lead to more aggressive outcomes.\\nThird, the users of VR matter. The personal characteristics and demographics \\nof VR users may influence their experiences within VR [57]. For example, users’ \\nperceptions of presence can vary dramatically in similar or even identical virtual \\nenvironments [58, 59]. It is therefore likely that user characteristics will also influence \\nthe utility of VR for increasing empathy. In Martingano et al. ’ s meta-analysis they \\nfound, for example, that the positive impact of VR on empathy was three times larger \\nfor children with Autism. Recent research also indicates that the utility of the body \\nownership illusion depends on user psychological traits. For example, lower scores on \\nthe traits of machismo and alexithymia were demonstrated to be facilitators for male \\nparticipants to embody a female victim of sexual harassment [60].\\nFinally, given the interaction between the type of VR and the type of empathy \\naroused there is no simple “one size fits all” answer to the most empathy-enhancing VR \\nexperiences. Unfortunately, our advice on how to promote emotional empathy using \\nVR (evocative imagery and immersive storytelling) is in almost direct contradiction to \\nour advice on how to use VR to increase cognitive empathy (subtle, ambiguous stimuli \\nthat challenge people to tell their own story). Clinicians, parents, charities, and educa-\\ntors should select VR experiences with care based on the empathic outcomes they wish \\nto evoke. In the future, it may be possible to design VR experiences that are emotionally \\nevocative while still leaving room for users to build upon the experience using their \\nown imagination. Indeed, we hope that the insights provided in this chapter may help \\ntake a small step in that direction, and prompt further research into this area.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThis work was funded by a Margarita Sala postdoctoral fellowship for the requali-\\nfication of the Spanish university system from the Ministry of Universities of the'),\n",

Recent \\nresearch has proposed that empathy is part of a continuum—from pity to sympa-\\nthy to empathy to compassion—and that compassion is the key to building good \\nrelationships because it includes actions. We offer an extension of this concept to \\ninclude neutrality (apathy) and add four constructs of opposition—from antipathy \\nto animosity to hostility to aggression. We describe all nine constructs with regard \\nto cognitive, emotional, and behavioral support or opposition. Further, we propose \\nthat it is useful to consider these constructs in terms of character, competence, \\ncontext, and communication at four psychosocial levels—personal, interpersonal, \\nteam, and organizational. We believe that relationships can be best addressed with \\nthese concepts in mind and that application of the support versus oppose poles of the \\naggression-compassion continuum are not equivalent to good and bad.\\nKeywords: compassion, empathy, sympathy, pity, apathy, antipathy, animosity, \\nhostility, aggression\\n1. Introduction\\nOver the past millennium, countless individuals have offered some version of the \\nconcept that actions are particularly important to human relationships. In the 1200s, \\nFrancisican friar Anthony of Padua is attributed with saying, “ … let your words teach \\nand your actions speak. ” In 1628, John Pym said, “ … actions are more precious than \\nwords. ” In 1693, Thomas Manton wrote, “ … Work and Scope … speak much louder \\nthan Words. ” In 1856, Abraham Lincoln said, “‘ Actions speak louder than words’ is the \\nmaxim. ” Or, in modern vernacular, “Don’t just talk the talk; walk the walk [1]. ” Y et, \\nwhat we do depends on what we think and feel. Therefore, it is important to under-\\nstand how thinking, feeling, and behaving relate to each other.\\nPsychology involves cognitions, motivations/emotions, and behaviors. Cognitions \\nare what we perceive, think, and believe. Motivations/emotions are how we feel and \\nunderlie why we think and act as we do. Behaviors are actions that we take, for and \\nagainst ourselves and others. What we think matters; what we feel matters; what we \\nsay matters; but what we actually do probably matters most, especially with regard to \\ntreatment and relationships with others.'),\n",

The fact that \\nempathy is the subject of this volume exemplifies the breadth and depth of interest is \\nthis psychosocial concept.\\nRecently, the question has been raised whether empathy per se is sufficient to under-\\nstand and to help improve relationships and the human condition or, instead, that \\nactions must flow from feelings to truly matter. Hougaard and colleagues [2, 3] have \\nproposed that empathy alone is necessary but not sufficient to optimize relationships; \\ninstead, compassion that includes actions is necessary to build better relationships. \\nThese authors further propose that empathy lies along a continuum of feeling and \\nacting with regard to others, ranging from pity to sympathy to empathy to compassion. \\nWe agree that distinguishing among these concepts and how they relate to each other \\nis valuable, but we believe that these concepts are a subset of a broader psychosocial \\ncontinuum that ranges from aggression to compassion. In addition, we suggest that \\nunderstanding the psychological constructs which exist along this broader continuum \\nalso requires consideration of four elements of each of us at four psychosocial levels \\n[4–7]. This chapter addresses these topics.\\nThis chapter begins with a discussion of the scholarly origins of empathy because \\nof the substantial attention already given to this particular concept and because \\nempathy is the focus of this volume. That discussion introduces the importance of \\nactions beyond thoughts and feelings. Next, we present nine different psychological \\nconstructs along an aggression-compassion continuum that includes two dimensions. \\nEach construct is defined and briefly explained. Then, we present four biopsychoso-\\ncial aspects of people—character, competence, context, communication—and four \\npsychosocial levels—personal, interpersonal, team, organizational. We relate these \\neight elements to the constructs of the Aggression-Compassion Continuum. Finally, \\nwe discuss how the constructs that appear on the Aggression-Compassion Continuum \\nare distinguished from good and bad cognitions, emotions, and behaviors.\\n2. Scholarly origins of “empathy”\\nEmpathy refers to cognitive and emotional responses aligned with others’ thoughts \\nand feelings. According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, empathy is “understanding, \\nbeing aware of, being sensitive to, and vicariously experiencing the feelings, thoughts, and \\nexperience of another of either the past or present without having the feelings, thoughts, \\nand experience fully communicated in an objectively explicit manner [8]. ”\\nInterestingly, in 1871 Charles Darwin described how humans and animals come \\nto help others. Darwin’ s discussion of what he called “sympathy” included concern \\nand actions that are more similar to what we now refer to as “empathy” and “compas-\\nsion [9]. ” This focus on concern and actions for the welfare of others complemented \\nDarwin’ s notions of competition and survival of the fittest [10].\\nConsistent with Darwin’ s Theory of Continuity of Species, primatologist Frans de \\nWaal has noted that apes and other infrahuman species also demonstrate behaviors \\nthat involve caring for others and, perhaps, feeling the emotions of others [11]. \\nShortly after Darwin’ s [9] discussion about humans and animals helping others, the \\nGerman concept of “Einfühlung”—or “feeling into”—was introduced by Robert \\nVischer in 1873 to explain relations of people to others and to artwork [12].

Curtis and Elliott [15] \\nfor a historical overview). Edward Titchener [16] and James Ward (cf. Lanzoni [17]) \\ntranslated this concept with the English word “empathy [12]. ”\\nIn the twentieth century, empathy has been addressed in more detail by authors, \\nscholars, and scientists with a wide range of interests and expertise. The study and \\nanalysis of empathy and how it relates to other psychological constructs, such as \\nsympathy and compassion, is ongoing among psychologists and neuroscientists.\\nFor example, author and motivational speaker Brené Brown has offered that \\nempathy involves four qualities that distinguish it from sympathy [18–21]:\\n• To be able to see the world as others see it\\n• To be nonjudgmental\\n• To understand another’ s feelings\\n• To communicate your understanding of that person’ s feelings\\nOther researchers have differentiated between “emotional or affective empathy” \\nand “cognitive empathy, ” where “affective empathy” involves sensations and feelin gs \\nin response to others’ emotions and “cognitive empathy” involves identification and \\nunderstanding of others’ emotions [22, 23].\\nEmotional empathy consists of three separate components, according to Hodges \\nand Myers:\\n• Feeling the same emotion as another person\\n• Personal distress in response to perceiving another’ s plight\\n• Feeling compassion for another person\\nCognitive empathy (or empathic accuracy) refers to how well we can perceive and \\nunderstand the emotions of another [23, 24].\\nPsychologists Daniel Goleman and Paul Ekman have identified three components \\nof empathy, that include cognitive and emotional (or affective) and adding “compas-\\nsionate empathy”— a prelude to Hougaard and Carter’ s distinction between empathy \\nand compassion [22]. With regard to these three components of empathy [11, 22, 25]:\\n• Emotional empathy involves sharing another's feelings and matching that \\nperson's behavioral states by “simulation”\\n• Cognitive empathy or perspective taking or theory of mind involves thinking \\nabout and understanding another's feelings\\n• Empathetic concern, or compassion, adds motivation and intent to act in order to \\ndo something about another’ s suffering\\nDenworth [26] has suggested that empathetic concern is “compassion” and \\nincludes motivation to help; i.e., to take action. Neuroscientists also are studying\"),\n",

Empathy requires the involvement of neural networks that underlie percep-\\ntion of others’ emotions, ability to connect with them emotionally and cognitively, \\nand ability to distinguish between our own and others’ emotions [29].\\nSocial neuroscientists have offered two theories of empathy: (a) Simulation \\nTheory and (b) Theory of the Mind. Simulation Theory proposes that empathy occurs \\nbecause when we see another person experiencing an emotion, we simulate that to \\nknow what it feels like. It has been suggested that this phenomenon involves “mirror \\nneurons” that are activated when we observe and experience emotion and that the \\nmedial prefrontal cortex is primarily involved. Theory of Mind proposes that we use \\nthought processes to explain the mental state of others. In addition, context and situa-\\ntion affect which of these empathetic responses occur [23, 28, 30].\\nWith regard to compassion, Gilbert [31] has suggested that compassion arose \\nfrom the evolutionary advantage of caring for others, especially offspring, kin, and \\nin-group allies. Rasmus Hougaard [32] has proposed that compassion is better for \\nhumanity than empathy for four reasons:\\n• Empathy is impulsive. Compassion is deliberate.\\n• Empathy is divisive. Compassion is unifying.\\n• Empathy is inert. Compassion is active.\\n• Empathy is draining. Compassion is regenerative.\\nHe also argues that: compassion can be developed; we should have more self-\\ncompassion; and that we should practice compassion daily [32].\\nNeff has emphasized the importance of self-compassion as well as compassion for \\nother people [33–35]. Hougaard and colleagues [2, 3] went even further and proposed \\nthat empathy alone is not sufficient to optimize relationships. Instead, these authors \\nemphasized that compassion is necessary to influence relationships because compas-\\nsion includes actions. These authors offered a pictorial representation of a continuum \\nof feeling and acting with regard to others, ranging from pity to sympathy to empathy \\nto compassion. We believe that this representation is important and relevant to \\nconsider in building relationships, but that it is only part of a broader continuum and \\nadditional, related concepts.\\n3. The aggression-compassion continuum\\nFigure 1 depicts nine constructs that we believe are relevant to human rela-\\ntions and well-being (including self, dyads, teams, and organizations): Aggression, \\nHostility, Animosity, Antipathy, Apathy, Pity, Sympathy, Empathy, Compassion. The \\nfour constructs that appear in the upper right quadrant and in the manner presented \\nin Figure 1 are based on Hougaard and Carter [2]. The addition of the other five con-\\nstructs with the particular two-dimension labels is new .

In \\naddition, each construct appears in Figure 1 in a location meant to correspond to the \\nrelative amount of each type of support or opposition. Each of the nine constructs is \\ndefined and differentiated in this section of the chapter following a comment about \\nword meanings.\\n3.1 A comment about word meanings\\nThe study of the origin of words and the way in which their meanings change \\n(Etymology) is relevant to understand the distinctions among the concepts along \\nthe Aggression-Compassion continuum. Words with the “–ion” suffix (including \\nAggression and Compassion) are nouns of state, condition, or action. Words with the \\n“–ity” suffix (including Pity, Apathy, Antipathy, Animosity, Hostility) are nouns of \\ncondition or quality of being. Words that include “–path” refer to “suffering” and  \\n“–pathy” refers to “one versed in” (for example, Apathy, Antipathy) [36]. Based on \\nthis information about word origins, Aggression and Compassion are appropriate \\npoles on the Action (Behavior) axis of Figure 1.\\n3.2 The “support” quadrant of the aggression-compassion continuum\\nThe upper right quadrant of Figure 1 lists four psychological constructs and can \\nbe broadly categorized as the “support” quadrant because all of the constructs that \\nappear in this quadrant provide some sort of support. The support can be cognitive \\nand emotional; it also can be behavioral support. The four constructs that appear \\nin this quadrant increase in amount of all types of support provided from pity to \\nsympathy to empathy to compassion.\\nFigure 1 . \\nA gg\\n\\x1c \\x0c\\nss\\n\\r\\non-compassion continuum.'),\n",

The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines pity as “sympathetic \\nsorrow for one suffering, distressed, or unhappy [37]. ” Pity can be summed up by, \\n“I\\xa0feel sorry for you [2, 38]. ”\\nSymp\\n\\x11 thy refers to one’ s own thoughts and deep feelings of concern for others. \\nThe Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines sympathy as “an affinity, association, or \\nrelationship between persons or things wherein whatever affects one similarly affects \\nthe other [39]. ” Sympathy involves a deeper, more personal level of concern than pity \\nwith pity as an expression of sorrow . Sympathy involves understanding from one’ s \\nown perspective and does not include shared emotion with others. Sympathy can be \\nsummed up by, “I feel for you [2]. ”\\nEmpathy refers to cognitive and emotional responses aligned with others’ thoughts \\nand feelings . It involves a cognitive and emotional connection that assumes the \\nperspective and feelings of others and includes understanding why others feel as they  \\ndo. According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, empathy involves “understand-\\ning, being aware of, being sensitive to, and vicariously experiencing the feelings, \\nthoughts, and experience of another of either the past or present without having the \\nfeelings, thoughts, and experience fully communicated in an objectively explicit man-\\nner [8]. ” Empathy can be summed up by, “I feel with you [2, 40]. ”\\nCompassion refers to cognitive, emotional, and behavioral responses (or intention \\nto act) in response to others’ thoughts and feelings. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary \\ndefines compassion as “sympathetic consciousness of others’ distress together with a \\ndesire to alleviate it [41]. ” Compassion can be summed up by, “I am here to help and \\nsupport you [2, 35]. ”\\n3.3 The neutral point of the aggression-compassion continuum\\nApathy refers to a lack of thoughts or feelings. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary \\ndefines apathy as a “lack of feeling or emotion; impassiveness; lack of interest or \\nconcern; indifference [42]. ” Apathy turns a blind eye to issues, situations, and people. \\nIt is, therefore, the “neutral” point on the Aggression-Compassion Continuum and \\ncan be summed up by, “I don’t care [40]. ”\\n3.4 The “Oppose” quadrant of the aggression-compassion continuum\\nThe lower left quadrant of Figure 1 lists four psychological constructs and can be \\nbroadly categorized as the “oppose” quadrant because all of the constructs that appear \\nin this quadrant provide some sort of opposition. The opposition can be cognitive and \\nemotional; it also can be behavioral opposition. The four constructs that appear in \\nthis quadrant increase in amount of all types of opposition provided from antipathy \\nto animosity to hostility to aggression.\\nAntipathy refers to dislike according to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary [43]. It \\nincludes opposition in feeling, aversion, dislike, repugnance, distaste. Antipathy can \\nbe summed up as, “I don’t like you [44]. ”\\nAnimosity refers to a stronger dislike. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines \\nanimosity as “a strong feeling of dislike or hatred; ill will or resentment tending \\ntoward active hostility; an antagonistic attitude [45]. ” Animosity is violent hatred \\nleading to opposition and active enmity.

Psychosocial elements to consider\\nWith regard to the nine psychological constructs on the Aggression-Compassion \\ncontinuum, there may be a tendency to think about these nine psychological con-\\nstructs as involving relationships only between oneself and another individual. In \\nfact, they are relevant to four psychosocial levels: Personal, Interpersonal, Team, \\nOrganizational. These four categories have been described as part of the Leader-\\nFollower Framework (LF2) because they refer to and help guide understanding of \\nthe individual (personal or self), relationships between two people (interpersonal), \\ninteractions within small teams, and consideration of large groups, cultures, systems \\n(organizational). The LF2 also distinguishes among four biopsychosocial aspects of \\npeople: character (who we are), competence (what we think, feel, and do), context \\n(when and where we are), and communication (how we express ourselves and seek \\nunderstanding). Each of these topics is described below [4–7]:\\nCharacter (Who we are) refers to biological, psychological, and social aspects \\nof each person or group (e.g., physical characteristics, demographics, personality, \\nattitudes, beliefs, values, biases). Character includes integrity, reliability, responsibil-\\nity, dependability, and moral compass, but also can include the opposite of each of \\nthese admirable qualities.\\nCompetence (What we know and do) refers to knowledge, skills, and attitudes \\n(KSAs) relevant to a particular role, position, task, or situation as well as to more \\ngeneral KSAs (e.g., critical thinking, decision-making, problem solving, open-mind-\\nedness, emotional intelligence).\\nContext (When and Where we are) includes physical (outside and inside us), \\npsychological, social, and cultural environments, such as time of day, climates, \\nnutritional state, sleep, mental and behavioral health, size of group, relationships \\nwithin a group, societal practices, and belief systems. Context also includes effects of \\nphysical and mental stress or misunderstanding that can alter thoughts, feelings, and \\nbehaviors.\\nCommunication (How we strive for understanding) includes sending and receiving \\ninformation, verbally and nonverbally.\\nPersonal refers to psychological, biological, and experiential aspects of the indi-\\nvidual or oneself. Personal Character includes demographics, attitudes, values, beliefs, \\nbiases, personality, emotions, motivations, and self-awareness. Personal Competence \\nincludes knowledge, skills, abilities, and actions. Personal Context includes physical,'),\n",

Personal \\nCommunication includes abilities to take in and record information (e.g., reading, \\nunderstanding, notes, reflections, how others perceive us vs how we perceive ourself).\\nInterpersonal refers to dyadic relationships between two people. Interpersonal \\nCharacter includes shared or opposing cognitions and emotions. Interpersonal \\nCompetence includes shared or opposing actions. Interpersonal Context includes physi-\\ncal and psychosocial environments relevant to the dyad. Interpersonal Communication \\ninvolves sharing information and understanding (or lack thereof) between the dyad.\\nTeam is a small group of people mutually committed to common goals. Team \\nCharacter refers to shared values and trust among the members. Team Competence \\nrefers to understanding the KSAs of the members. Team Context refers to the envi-\\nronments and situations in which the members exist. Team Communication involves \\nshared understanding among the members.\\nOrganizational refers to large groups of people, institutions, and systems. \\nOrganizational Character refers to the large group’ s values and mission. Organizational \\nCompetence refers to the large group’ s KSAs. Organizational Context refers to the large \\ngroup’ s culture. Organizational Communication involves understanding among the \\nmembers of the large groups.\\n5.  Relating the LF2 elements to the constructs of the aggression-\\ncompassion continuum\\nWe submit that all eight of the LF2 elements should be applied to better under-\\nstand each of the nine constructs along the Aggression-Compassion Continuum. This \\ntype of analysis will likely reveal contributing factors to each of the constructs. Such \\nunderstanding may suggest how to better work with others.\\nFor example, consider Aggression and each of the LF2 elements. Is the reason an \\nindividual acts aggressively because of character (e.g., personality, differing values, \\nmental health), competence (e.g., KSAs to act aggressively or the lack of KSAs to \\ncontrol oneself and to not act aggressively), context (e.g., hunger, tiredness, stress, \\nsituation, existential threat), or communication (e.g., the only option to convey \\nintended meaning or lack of options to reach understanding)? Is the individual acting \\naggressively towards oneself (personal), one other (interpersonal), a team, or an \\norganization/culture system? Also, is the individual acting aggressively because of \\npersonal (e.g., self-hate, frustration), interpersonal (e.g., disagreement with a single \\nother person), team (e.g., going along with others or opposing particular others), or \\norganizational (e.g., the culture of the larger group) reasons? A similar analysis can be \\napplied to the other three constructs in the Opposition Quadrant of the Aggression-\\nCompassion Continuum: Hostility, Animosity, Antipathy.\\nAs another example, consider Apathy and each of the LF2 elements. Is the reason \\nan individual does not care, does not express any emotions, and does not take any \\nactions because of character (e.g., personality, perception of hopelessness, physical \\nillness, mental illness, picking their battle), competence (e.g., lacks the KSAs to take \\nany action relevant to the situation at hand, overwhelmed with other things on their \\nplate), context (e.g., lack of necessary resources to act, exhaustion, overwhelming \\nodds or opposition), or communication (e.g., lacking any way to communicate, not \\nreceiving any communication that the issue or situation is worth addressing)? Is the \\nlack of caring directed at oneself, one other, a team, an organization? Also, is the \\nreason that an individual does not care because of personal (e.g., lack of self-esteem,'),\n",

A similar analysis can be applied to the other three constructs in the Support \\nQuadrant of the Aggression-Compassion Continuum: Pity, Sympathy, Empathy.\\nIn addition, consider Compassion and each of the LF2 elements. Is an individual \\nacting compassionately because of character (e.g., personality, understanding their \\nown and others values and beliefs), competence (e.g., having the KSAs to act and \\nperform compassionate acts), context (e.g., the needs of the recipient(s) of the \\ncompassionate acts are overwhelmingly heart-breaking, understanding of the stress \\nwith the individual, team, or organization), or communication (e.g., the recipient(s) \\nof the compassionate acts effectively expressed need for help, the provider(s) of \\nthe compassionate acts can effectively understand and communicate with others to \\nunderstand what they are saying and discuss what is needed)? Is the individual acting \\ncompassionately towards oneself (personal), one other (interpersonal), a team, or an \\norganization/culture system? Also, is the individual acting compassionately because \\nof personal (e.g., acting in accordance with one’ s own values), interpersonal (e.g., \\nconcern for that particular person), team (e.g., commitment to the team), or organi-\\nzational (e.g., commitment to the particular organization) reasons?\\nTo understand and enhance relationships, we suggest that it is useful to consider \\nwhich of the LF2 elements contribute to the particular psychological state and which \\nof these elements may be key to modulate (either to increase or to decrease) the given \\npsychological construct. With regard to the nine constructs along the Aggression-\\nCompassion continuum, it is important to consider that there likely is a tendency to \\nthink of each construct as relevant especially to relationships and interactions with \\none other person (interpersonal) or a group of people. But each construct also can \\nbe applied to oneself and to organizations. We need to act with compassion and not \\nwith aggression towards ourselves as well as consider to whom and in what context \\nwe should allow ourselves to experience and exercise each of the nine constructs. In \\nother words, we need to maximize our emotional and social intelligence so that we are \\naware of motivations and emotions that accompany and underlie our own thoughts \\nand actions as well as the motivations and emotions that accompany and underlie the \\nthoughts and actions of others [50–53].\\n6.  Support and oppose are positive and negative, respectively; but positive \\nand negative do not equal good and bad\\nAnother important point to consider is that although “Support” and “Oppose” \\ncan be considered as corresponding to “good” and “bad” poles of the Aggression-\\nCompassion continuum, that type of identity simply is not true. Most if not all \\npublications about pity, sympathy, empathy, compassion imply or state explicitly that \\nthese concepts and corresponding actions (in the case of compassion) are, indeed, \\n“good. ” Conversely, it is implied or explicitly stated that antipathy, animosity, hostil-\\nity, and aggression are “bad. ” Neither of these generalizations is correct.\\nProviding cognitive, emotional, and behavioral support— as is done when exercis-\\ning the four constructs depicted in the upper right—for kindness, generosity, altru-\\nism, open-mindedness, liberty, freedom, democracy, and so on certainly would be'),\n",

Aggression, hostility, and the other \\nconstructs on the “oppose” cognitive, emotional, and behavioral poles certainly \\nwould be considered “bad” when the opposition is to kindness, generosity, altruism, \\nopen-mindedness, liberty, freedom, democracy. Conversely, opposing in thoughts, \\nemotions, and actions bigotry, robbery, hatred, dishonesty, cruelty, slavery, authori-\\ntarianism, and so on, would be considered as “good. ”\\nSo, it is important to recognize that supporting others can be good or bad. And \\nopposing others can be for good or bad. Aggression and Compassion involve actions \\nof opposition or support, respectfully, and, thereby, set the poles of a psychologi-\\ncal continuum with regard to self and others, but who and what we are opposing or \\nsupporting determines what is good and bad from each of our perspectives and based \\non each of our values. Generalizations such as “both sides are to blame” and “there are \\ngood people on both sides, ” are not always true.\\nAdditionally, it is important to recognize that the value and accompanying good or \\nbad of each construct along the Aggression-Compassion Continuum also depends on \\nthe situation and people involved. For example, empathy can be so powerful that feel-\\ning the pain or suffering of another can be damaging to the well-intentioned empath. \\nAlso, empathy can be so absorbing that it freezes or prevents the empath from taking \\naction to help others. Compassion, despite providing well-intentioned support, can \\nbe counter-productive if provided to someone(s) who does not want the actions of \\nsupport or who needs to learn to act for themselves. A common dilemma confronts \\nparents who act to help their children with every challenge, even when their children \\nare not in danger and need to learn to handle their own challenges and to accept and \\nto be resilient after experiencing their own disappointments or failures. Conversely, \\naggression, even when opposing dangers, can be bad if the individuals being helped \\nwant to handle the situation themselves or need to learn to handle the situation \\nthemselves.\\n7. Conclusion\\nThe Aggression-Compassion Continuum includes nine psychological constructs \\nthat involve different amounts of cognitive and emotional support or opposition and \\ndifferent amounts of action. It is important to understand where you are along this \\ncontinuum to optimize relationships with others as well as your own well-being. We \\nbelieve that applying the eight elements of the Leader-Follower Framework when \\nconsidering relevant points on the Aggression-Compassion Continuum also will help \\nto enhance emotional and social intelligence.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThe authors greatly appreciate discussions with colleagues about the psychosocial \\nconstructs and topics addressed in this chapter.'),\n",

Introduction\\nIn the past 20\\xa0years, the interest in the so-called park personality traits in the area \\nof individual differences has been exponentially rising. What is creditable for this is \\nthe introduction of the Dark Triad of personality [1], which consists of three distinct, \\nbut conceptually and empirically overlapping traits: Machiavellianism, narcissism, and \\npsychopathy, while relatively recently sadism was added to this constellation, forming \\nthe Dark Tetrad [2, 3]. It is important to note that, although these traits (apart from \\nMachiavellianism) migrated from clinical literature and practice and are similar to \\nrespective personality disorders (i.e. narcissistic personality disorder and antisocial \\npersonality disorder as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental \\nDisorders, DSM-5, by American Psychiatric Association [4], and sadistic personality \\ndisorder defined in earlier versions of DSM [5]), they refer to subclinical variants in \\nthe Dark Triad/Tetrad constellation (for a more detailed overview of Dark Triad and \\nTetrad traits, see [6, 7], respectively). Machiavellianism is characterized by duplicitous \\ninterpersonal style, manipulation, a cynical disregard of morality and a focus on \\nself-interest and personal gain [8], narcissism by grandiose self-concept and attention-\\ncraving [9], and psychopathy by impulsivity and callous thrill-seeking [10], while \\nsadism is characterized by the enjoyment of other people’ s suffering [11]. However, \\nalthough each of the traits has its specific features, they also share a common core of \\ncallousness (i.e. low empathy) and antagonism (e.g. [12–14]).'),\n",

More specifically, narcissistic personality disorder refers to a \\npervasive pattern of grandiosity (in fantasy or behavior), need for admiration, and \\nlack of empathy, and one of the criteria for this disorder listed in DSM-5 is “lacks \\nempathy: is unwilling to recognize or identify with the feelings and needs of others” \\n([4], p. 670). The essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is a pervasive \\npattern of disregard for, and violation of, the wishes, rights, or feelings of others, and \\ncallousness is one of the DSM-5 criteria for this personality disorder (specifically, \\n“lack of remorse, as indicated by being indifferent to or rationalizing having hurt, \\nmistreated, or stolen from another” ([4], p. 659). The sadistic personality disorder \\nwas defined by a pervasive pattern of sadistic and cruel behavior and was identified in \\nDSM-III-R as: using physical cruelty or violence to establish dominance in a relation-\\nship; humiliating others; treating, or disciplining others harshly; being amused or \\ntaking pleasure in the psychological or physical suffering of others; lying to harm oth-\\ners; intimidating others to get them to do what he/she wants; restrictin g the autonomy \\nof close ones; and/or being fascinated by violence, weapons, injury, or torture [5]. \\nThus, callousness, lack of empathy, and antagonism are the defining features of each \\nof these three personality disorders.\\nAs noted earlier, Machiavellianism had a different etiology than the other three \\nDark Tetrad traits. Rather than a clinical syndrome (i.e. a personality disorder), \\nthis concept was named after the renaissance philosopher Nicolo Machiavelli and \\nresembles a manipulative and callous character with a cynical worldview , duplicitous \\ntactics, and strategic planning (see [15]). Moreover, it has been noted that the lack of \\nempathy plays a causal role in determining Machiavellian behavior [16]. Analogously \\nto the lack of empathy as the key common feature of dark traits’ clinical counterparts, \\nthe common feature explaining both the theoretical and empirical overlap between \\nthe Dark Tetrad traits is callousness, or lack of empathy toward others [7].\\nIt is important to note that, from the evolutionary perspective, dark traits are \\nadaptive, and the lack of empathy as a central feature of the dark traits may have an \\nevolutionary advantage, enabling the dark personalities to get ahead. For example, \\nin accordance with frequency-dependent selection, a small number of cheaters \\nwith exploitative tendencies can flourish in a society where the majority is oriented \\ntoward cooperation [17] (see [18] for more details on the evolutionary perspective \\non the Dark Triad traits). Similarly, fundamental neural mechanisms explaining \\nsadism have been postulated [19–21]. More specifically, sadism can be viewed as a \\nphysiological response to, for example, war-induced callousness: an indifference to \\nthe suffering of others could be gradually transformed by evolutionary selection into \\nthe enjoyment of cruelty, especially if victims are perceived as dangerous outgroups, \\nand the sadistic behavior could promote fitness via the maintenance of personal and \\nsocial power.\\nIn line with theoretical conceptualizations and clinical observations, empirical \\nfindings consistently show that dark traits are related to empathy deficits [22, 23]; \\nhowever, the associations between specific forms of empathy and dark traits are \\nnot so consistent. Furthermore, there are indications that there are individuals \\nhigh both on empathy and dark traits [24], and that individuals with elevated dark \\ntraits can be empathic in certain circumstances [25, 26]. Thus, let us closely explore \\nthe findings on relations between dark personality traits and specific forms of \\nempathy.'),\n",

Dark traits and specific forms of empathy\\nAlbeit there are different conceptualizations of empathy, there is a consensus that \\nit comprises two components: a cognitive (i.e. the cognitive assessment of affective \\nexperiences of others) and affective one (i.e. sharing and adequately responding to \\naffective experiences of others), which have been confirmed in neuropsychological \\nresearch [27].\\nIn line with the callous, manipulative, and exploitative nature of dark personali -\\nties, it may be assumed that individuals high on dark personality traits should have \\na good understanding of the affective experiences of others (i.e. have high cognitive \\nempathy) which enables them to manipulate and exploit others, but at the same \\ntime, they should not care about the feelings of others (i.e. have low affective empa-\\nthy) to behave in such a manner. Indeed, research consistently points to deficits in \\naffective empathy in individuals with pronounced dark personality traits [23, 28–34], \\nwith psychopathy showing the strongest negative relationship with this form of \\nempathy, followed by Machiavellianism and sadism. However, the situation is not so \\nclear when it comes to cognitive empathy. Namely, while some studies indicate that \\nat least one of the dark traits is linked to impaired cognitive empathy [23, 35, 36], \\nothers point to a positive relationship of at least one of the dark traits with cognitive \\nempathy [23, 24, 32, 34], with narcissism most often being that trait.\\nGiven the narcissistic tendency of overestimating their abilities to read and \\nunderstand the emotions of others [37], a question arises is the positive link between \\ncognitive empathy and narcissism due to this tendency. However, findings are showing \\nthat narcissism is also positively associated with emotion recognition tasks [34, 38] \\nthat are considered closely related to cognitive empathy, indicating that narcissism is \\nin fact linked to higher cognitive empathy. The plausible explanation of this positive \\nlink is that the narcissistic need for admiration and reinforcement of their grandiose \\nview of themselves requires a better understanding of how others see them, implying \\na need for a slightly superior cognitive empathy.\\nSimilar considerations regarding the empirically observed positive link between \\nnarcissism and cognitive empathy can be found in the proposed criteria of narcissistic \\npersonality disorder in the alternative DSM-5 model for personality disorders, which \\nstates that narcissistic personality disorder can be characterized by being “excessively \\nattuned to reactions of others, but only if perceived as relevant to self” ([4], p. 767). \\nOn the other hand, the antisocial personality disorder in this model can be character-\\nized by a “lack of concern for feelings, needs, or suffering of others; lack of remorse \\nafter hurting or mistreating another” ([4], p. 764), indicating more serious empathic \\nimpairments associated with this disorder. Indeed, psychopathy, observed in the Dark \\nTriad constellation, exhibits the strongest negative relations with adverse psychoso-\\ncial outcomes, such as emotional deficits (i.e. lack of empathy), aggression, impulsiv-\\nity, and interpersonal problems (see [39]). Comparingly, some studies on moderation \\nbetween empathy and psychopathy indicated that, if trait psychopathy is high, then \\nindividuals with higher levels of cognitive empathy are more likely to engage in \\naggressive behavior such as trolling [31, 36]. Moreover, there are findings that the lack \\nof cognitive empathy mediates the relationship between psychopathy and specific \\nforms of prosocial behavior (for details see [40]), highlighting the importance of the \\npsychopathy-empathy relationship.\\nAs one of the characteristics of Machiavellianism is the use of strategic manipu-\\nlation, it is assumed that Machiavellianism is linked to higher cognitive empathy.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'producer': 'GPL Ghostscript 9.25', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 17.4 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': \"D:20230517195218Z00'00'\", 'moddate': \"D:20230517195218Z00'00'\", 'source': 'Data\\\\external_content empathy 147.pdf', 'total_pages': 172, 'page': 93, 'page_label': '82'}, page_content='Empathy - Advanced Research and Applications\\n82\\nHowever, some studies failed to find any connection between cognitive empathy \\nand Machiavellianism (e.g. [41, 42]). One of the reasons for inconsistent findings \\nof previous studies may lay in using different measures of empathy, reflecting \\nsomewhat different conceptualizations of this construct, such as the Interpersonal \\nReactivity Index (IRI [43], defining empathy as reactions of one individual to the \\nobserved experiences of another [44]), Basic Empathy Scale (BES [45], concep-\\ntualizing empathy as the understanding and sharing in another’ s emotional state \\nor context), or Empathy Quotient (EQ [46], which conceptualizes empathy as the \\nability to recognize and understand the thoughts and feelings of others, as well as to \\nrespond to others’ thoughts and feelings with appropriate emotion). Thus, Turner \\net\\xa0al. [32] examined the relationship of Dark Triad traits with cognitive and affective \\nempathy using multiple questionnaires for both empathy (i.e. BES, EQ , and one more \\nindependent measure) and the dark traits and through simultaneous consideration \\nof all constructs in a single latent variable model, and on a large sample (over 1000) \\nof participants. Their results indicated that dark traits are related more to affective \\nthan to cognitive empathy: all three dark traits were related to lower levels of affective \\nempathy, but this relationship was weaker for narcissism, while cognitive empathy \\nwas positively related to narcissism and Machiavellianism, but unrelated to psychopa-\\nthy. Results regarding sadism are following the same pattern, with sadism being more \\nstrongly related to affective than cognitive empathy [3, 31, 36].\\nIt should be noted that, although the Dark Tetrad traits share a common core of \\ncallousness/low empathy, due to the unique features of each of the traits, the mani-\\nfestation of this characteristic could be different among each trait [7], as well as the \\npsychological processes beneath the exploitative behavior common for the dark traits \\n[18]. More specifically, individuals high on narcissism might lack empathy for those \\nthey step on in their quest for public admiration, and the exploitation of others may \\nbe a result of their self-centeredness. Individuals high on psychopathy impulsively \\nreach for what they want, caring little if others will get hurt along the way. Individuals \\nhigh on Machiavellianism may take care while taking advantage of others and exhibit \\ninterpersonal indifference if someone interferes with their goals. Finally, individuals \\nhigh on everyday sadism will seek opportunities to observe or even induce suffering \\nin others.\\nFurthermore, a recent meta-analytical finding that empathy and aggression are, \\ndespite the assumptions regarding the importance of empathy for aggressive behavior, \\nvirtually unrelated [47], indicated that current conceptions of affective empathy could \\nbe too narrow , failing to capture the full range of the construct. Thus, Vachon and \\nLynam [48] proposed a new measure of empathy: Affective and Cognitive Measure of \\nEmpathy (ACME). ACME conceptualizes cognitive empathy as empathic accuracy  \\n(i.e. the ability to detect and understand what others are feeling), and affective \\nempathy distinguishes between affective resonance, conceptualized as most tradi-\\ntional measures of affective empathy (i.e. empathic concern, sympathy, compassion, \\ninvolving an emotional response in the observer congruent in valence to the target) \\nand affective dissonance, conceptualized as the experience of a contradictory emo -\\ntional response (e.g. taking pleasure in others’ pain or feeling annoyed with others’ \\nhappiness). In line with previous findings linking schadenfreude (i.e. pleasure and joy \\nderived from another person’ s misfortune) with dark personality traits [49, 50], dark \\ntraits indeed generally exhibit stronger relations to affective dissonance than reso-\\nnance [48, 51, 52]. The extension of the range of affective empathy from high levels of  \\nresonance (i.e. empathy) to low levels of resonance (i.e. indifference and callousness) \\nto include the dissonant responses is especially important for the dark traits research.'),\n",

Thus, it is advisable to also include \\nsome other empathy measures in future research, such as behavioral (e.g. picture \\nviewing tasks and stories [53]), physiological (e.g. heart rate, electroencephalogram \\n(EEG)), and/or neuroscientific measures (e.g. magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) \\nand functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)). Namely, including different \\nmodalities of empathy measures could provide a comprehensive approach to empathy \\nassessment and enable finer insights into the relationship between dark traits and \\nempathy. In fact, some of the studies [25, 26] using the multi-modal approach to \\nempathy provided valuable insights that will be discussed in detail in the next section.\\nAs there are sex differences in both empathy and the dark traits, with women \\nscoring higher on especially affective empathy [54], and men scoring higher on the \\ndark traits [39, 55], some studies further investigated gender differences in the rela-\\ntions between dark traits and empathy. It has been shown that empathy mediates sex \\ndifferences in the Dark Triad traits, indicating that underlying sex differences in the \\nDark Triad traits may reflect individual differences in empathy [22, 35]. Furthermore, \\nthe relations between Dark Triad traits seem to be stronger in women than in men, \\nespecially for narcissism [22, 56], while the relationship between empathy and \\npsychopathy seems to be stronger in men [22]. The finding that the link between the \\nDark Triad and limited empathy might be primarily through narcissism in women \\nand psychopathy in men suggests different implications for the development of the \\ndark traits and limited empathy in men and women and links to different outcomes. \\nFor example, men with limited empathy and high on psychopathy may pursue risky \\nlifestyle and opportunism, while women high on narcissism may pursue parasitic \\nrelationship styles. Thus, it is important to take sex differences into account in future \\nresearch on the relationship between dark traits and empathy, above and beyond \\nmerely controlling for sex, in order to get a better insight into the complexity of these \\nrelations.\\nA further problem with previous research regarding the relationship between \\ndark personality traits and empathy is related to neglecting the multidimensional -\\nity of each of the dark traits. Namely, each of the dark traits is conceptualized as \\na multidimensional construct: Machiavellianism comprises a cynical worldview , \\nmanipulative behavior, and disregard for morality [8], psychopathy comprises \\ncunningness, lack of remorse, impulsive, and antisocial lifestyle [9], and narcissism \\nexhibitionism, interpersonal dominance, and need for attention [10], while sadism \\ncan have direct and vicarious forms (see [11]), and there are findings on different \\nrelations between different dimensions of each of the dark traits and different \\nforms of empathy [36, 57–59]. For example, vulnerable narcissism (characterized by \\ninterpersonal coldness, hostility, egocentricity, negative emotions, need for rec -\\nognition, and entitlement) was negatively related to all aspects of empathy, while \\ngrandiose narcissism (characterized by immodesty, self-assurance, exhibitionism, \\ndominance, and aggression; see [9] for a more detailed distinction between these \\ntwo forms of narcissism) was linked to higher empathy and perspective taking [59]. \\nSimilarly, there are findings indicating that Factor 2 psychopathy (characterized \\nby erratic lifestyle and antisocial behavior) is linked to deficits in both cognitive \\nand affective empathy, while Factor 1 psychopathy (characterized by interpersonal \\nmanipulation and shallow affectivity; for a more detailed distinction between these'),\n",

These findings \\ncorroborate the general notion that it is advisable to consider the multidimensional -\\nity of dark traits in investigating their relations with other constructs [60].\\n3. Can dark personalities be empathic?\\nAs described earlier, empirical findings largely point to emphatic deficits linked \\nto dark personality traits. However, the question is do individuals scoring high \\non dark personality traits lack the capacity (ability) or the disposition (trait) to \\nempathize? Kajonius and Björkman [30] found a very strong negative relationship \\nbetween Dark Triad traits and dispositional trait-based empathy, and the absence \\nof any relationship with ability-based empathy, indicating that individuals with \\npronounced dark traits possess a normal ability for empathy but have a low inclina -\\ntion to be empathic.\\nOne interesting paper [25] investigated whether narcissists can empathize with \\na person in distress in different contexts. In a series of three studies, it was shown \\nthat higher narcissism is linked to lower both self-reported empathy and emphatic \\nautonomic arousal (i.e. heart rate) in the context of different vignettes (presented as a \\nwritten text, video, or audio-recording). However, if instructed to take a perspective \\nof the target person, individuals scoring high on narcissism were capable of reporting \\nhigher empathy for a target person and responding to another’ s distress with the same \\nlevel of autonomic arousal as individuals scoring low on narcissism.\\nSimilarly, another interesting study [26] used fMRI to investigate vicarious rep-\\nresentations (i.e. neural activations in brain regions normally associated with feeling \\nspecific emotions that are triggered when witnessing the emotions of others, while \\nwitnessing what others do and sense recruits one’ s own motor and somatosensory \\ncortices) in male psychopaths while watching video clips of two hands in different \\ninteractions (neutral, love, pain, and exclusion). The results showed that, although \\nthe brain areas associated with vicarious activations to hand actions (i.e. pre-motor \\ncortices), sensations (i.e. primary and secondary somatosensory cortices), and emo-\\ntions (i.e. anterior cingulate and insula cortices) were under-activated in psychopathy \\ncompared to the control group, group differences attributable to vicarious activations \\nwere significantly reduced when psychopathic participants were instructed to emp a-\\nthize with the actors in the videos.\\nBoth studies indicate that, although individuals with pronounced dark traits \\ndo not seem to lack the ability to empathize, they do not have a spontaneous \\nemphatic reaction to others’ distress. Similarly, there are some indications that in \\nMachiavellianism lack of empathy might be due to a lack of motivation to be empathic \\n[42, 61]. It should be noted that, although these studies included only one of the dark \\ntraits, due to their common core of callousness [13, 14], empirical overlap [39], and \\nsimilar nomological networks [60, 62], it could be assumed that the similar principles \\nwould work for all the traits. More specifically, it seems that the mere instruction to \\ntake the perspective of a suffering person evokes physiological emphatic responses in \\nindividuals with pronounced dark traits reducing the deficits in empathy and has the \\npotential to move dark personalities to empathize in the same manner as individu-\\nals low on dark traits. Thus, interventions targeting perspective-taking practice, \\nemphasizing its value, and making this skill intrinsically appealing to also enhance \\nthe motivation to be empathic seems to be a promising path to boost empathy in dark \\npersonalities.'),\n",

On a large sample of nearly 1000 \\nindividuals, the researchers using the latent profile analysis identified four groups: \\nstandard Dark Triad group with high dark traits and low empathy, Typical group with \\naverage dark traits and empathy, Dark Empath group with higher empathy alongside \\nhigh dark traits, and Empath group with low dark traits and high empathy. Dark \\nEmpaths had a greater representation of men than women, showed higher extraver-\\nsion than all the other groups, and used more malicious humor and guilt induction \\nthan non-dark groups. Compared to the Dark Triad group, Dark Empaths were \\nhigher on agreeableness and grandiosity, lower on exploitativeness and interpersonal \\naggression, and had better well-being (i.e. lower anxiety), suggesting a more adap-\\ntive level in psychosocial functioning. However, the Dark Empath group remained \\nmore antagonistic, neurotic, stressed, and self-critical, compared to non-dark groups. \\nAlbeit compelling, these findings need to be replicated and extended to distinguish \\nbetween specific forms of empathy, which is a work in progress but has the potential \\nto shift our understanding of empathy in the context of dark traits.\\n4. Conclusion\\nEmpathy deficits have been consistently linked to dark personality traits  \\n(i.e. Machiavellianism, narcissism, psychopathy, and sadism) both theoretically \\nand empirically, and the findings point to stronger links between dark traits and \\ndeficits in affective empathy compared to cognitive empathy [32, 36]. However, due \\nto specific features of each of the dark traits, manifestations of empathic deficits in \\nDark Tetrad traits may be different. Moreover, there are indicators of gender differ -\\nences in links between the dark traits and empathy [22, 35, 56], indicating different \\ndevelopmental paths of the dark traits and limited empathy, and links to different \\noutcomes in men and women.\\nThe main issues in previous research on the relations between dark personality \\ntraits and empathy include problems with used measures of empathy and relying \\nsolely on self-reported measures. Thus, future research in this area should focus on \\ncombining self-report and other empathy measures (i.e. behavioral, physiological, \\nand/or neuroscientific measures). Finally, given that individuals with pronounced \\ndark personality traits do not lack the ability to empathize [30], but rather do not have \\na spontaneous emphatic reaction to others’ distress [25, 26], interventions targeting \\nperspective-taking practice seem to be a promising path to boost empathy in dark \\npersonalities.'),\n",

Beginning with Paulhus and Dean, we review \\nresearch comparing empathic reactions to a diverse array of animal species, as well as \\nto selected humans. Those authors coined the term phyloempathic hierarchy to describe \\nthe differential empathy that humans feel toward different species. Sophisticated \\nscaling techniques were applied to determine the unique drivers of empathic responses. \\nOverall, four animal characteristics (the “Big Four”) appeared to drive empathic \\nresponses: (1) Perceived intelligence, (2) size, (3) esthetic appeal, and (3) lack of harm -\\nfulness. Ranking high were monkeys, elephants, dogs, and cats. Y ounger versions of the \\nsame species (e.g., kittens vs. cats) elicited even more empathy. Sharks, cockroaches, \\nand snakes drew the least empathy. Those results have been replicated across 40\\xa0years \\nof research from many laboratories and many countries. This hierarchy presents a \\nchallenge to relying on empathy in decisions regarding the treatment of animals. \\nBottom line: The phyloempathic hierarchy resembles but deviates from the phylogenetic \\nhierarchy.\\nKeywords: empathy, research ethics, anthropomorphism\\n1. Introduction: Love, hate, and indifference \\nThe human tendency to affiliate with nonhuman animals 1 was explored in Edward \\nO. Wilson’ s landmark book Biophilia [1]. His term “biophilia” was coined to capture \\nthe intricate ways in which human and animal life are intertwined. At the time, he \\nnoted that 98% of the American population hold global positive views of animals. \\nThis chapter focuses on empathy, a specific aspect of that human positivity toward \\nanimals.\\nStandard-bearers of that sentiment include a number of powerful activist \\norganizations (e.g. the Humane Society, ASPCA, PETA, PHAIR): All are devoted \\nto investigating and ameliorating lapses in the humane treatment of animals. Such \\nlapses are usually a matter of indifferent care practices, but they trigger serious \\n1 Henceforth, I will refer to “nonhuman animals” simply as “animals. ”'),\n",

On the other hand, blatant human fear of animals (biophobia) \\nis also a widespread phenomenon [2]. Such hatred for certain animals (e.g. snakes & \\nspiders) can be explained by hard-wired responses traceable to evolutionary dangers \\n[3]. Disgust toward certain animals may have a parallel etiology [4]. Whether positive \\nor negative, culture-specific tendencies are typically established by collecting large \\nsamples of raters and assuming a consensus. Such estimates, however, are rather \\nsubjective and ephemeral.\\n2. Individual differences in perceivers\\nFrom love to hate to indifference, people vary in their attitudes toward animals. \\nThat diversity of attitudes among various demographic groups was investigated at \\nlength by Kellert and colleagues [5, 6]. Education, for example, had a clear impact. \\nMore educated respondents were more protective, emotionally attached, and \\nfactually informed about animals and the natural environment. Among the college-\\neducated, there was little difference in attitudes among science, liberal arts, social \\nscience, and education majors. SES differences were evident but far smaller. More \\nrecently, Taylor and Signal [7]confirmed that occupation and income did provide a \\nsubstantial benefit for attitudes to animals.\\nWomen generally tend to score higher on both animal empathy [8, 9] and human \\nempathy measures [10]. Supporting the sex difference. Sueur et\\xa0al. [11] reported a \\nsurvey aimed at clarifying how humans project anthropomorphism toward animals. \\nResults showed that men and older participants were less likely to attribute human-\\nlike mental states to animals. Overall, gender is one of the most reliable demographic \\npredictors of empathy.\\nNot surprisingly, the largest group difference was observed when Paul [12]\\ncompared the views of animal activists with those of animal researchers. The former \\ngroup believed that animals suffered more than the researchers believed and that the \\nbenefits of animal research were minimal. Because both “expert” groups have a vested \\ninterest in their views, the average citizen may find it difficult to draw conclusions.\\n3. Species differences\\nThe central issue in this chapter is the degree to which people empathize with \\ndifferent animal species. For centuries, zoologists have used the term ph\\n\\x1d l ogenetic \\nhierarchy to refer to the systematic variation in species complexity. Hence, a key ques-\\ntion is whether empathy for animals tracks the phylogenetic hierarchy. If so, we may \\ncare about animals to the extent that they are similar to us on that hierarchy.\\nUnfortunately, most empirical research on human reactions to animals has been \\nlimited to people’ s likes and dislikes of a few scattered species. Hence, generalizations \\nabout human-animal empathy have been rather speculative and presumptuous. I will \\nfocus on studies that compared empathy for a diverse set of animals. 2\\nThe first attempt to systematize empathic reactions across the spectrum was \\nreported by Paulhus and Dean [8]. Using a sample of 175 Columbia University \\nstudents, the authors compared mean reactions across 24 animals. The criterion \\nquestions included “Which animals should not be used in medical experiments, ” and \\n2 Methods that ask for “favorite animals” yield slightly different results (e.g., [13]).'),\n",

Using \\nmultidimensional preference scaling (MDPREF; [14]), the authors found that the \\nmost significant drivers of people’ s protective feelings toward animals were the (1) \\nperceived intelligence, (2) size, and (3) esthetic appeal of the animal. Perceived \\nharmfulness tended to diminish empathy. For short, they were dubbed the “Big Four. ”\\nAs well as the 24 animal species, the authors included several human target groups: \\nexperiment volunteers, children, and convicted criminals. Although many animal \\nspecies drew strong empathy, none exceeded the mean empathy awarded to any of the \\nhuman groups. However, a significant number of respondents (20%) were exceptions \\nto this rule. That is, they ranked at least one animal species higher than one human \\ngroup. Typically, that choice was a puppy vs. a convicted criminal. As an analogy to \\nthe phylogenetic hierarchy, the authors proposed a novel label for differential empa-\\nthy based on animal species, namely, the phyloempathic hierarchy.\\nShortly thereafter, a broader study was undertaken by Steven Kellert [5]. Support \\nfor this research included funding from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Agency. The study \\nincluded a wider breadth of species (k\\xa0=\\xa033), a larger sample, and a more representa-\\ntive sample of Americans. However, the ordering of animal attitudes was virtually \\nidentical to that reported by Paulhus and Dean [8]. 3 Followup studies from our lab \\nrevealed similar empathy rankings in other North American student samples, namely, \\nthe University of Georgia and the University of British Columbia [16].\\nThe latter program of research covered the widest range of animals (k\\xa0=\\xa044). In \\ncombined results from that three-sample study, the 20 animals receiving the highest \\nempathy ratings were as follows: Monkeys, dogs/cats, gorillas, whales, elephants, \\nhorses, bears, kangaroos, porpoises, deer, wolves/coyotes, penguins, rabbits, lions/\\ntigers, cows, raccoons, parrots, pigs, squirrels, and seals. The 20 animals drawing \\nthe lowest empathy ratings (starting at the bottom) were as follows: Cockroaches, \\nslugs, alligators/crocodiles, houseflies, eels, spiders, octopus, caterpillars, snakes, \\nsharks, frogs/toads, rats, bats, and fish. Based on the 24 animals in common, we \\ncorrelated those rankings with the Paulhus and Dean rankings. The rank order \\ncorrelation was .98.\\nBetween 1978 and 2014, however, some cohort changes were reported by George, \\nSlagle, Wilson, Moeller, and Bruskotter [17]. The greatest mean differences were \\nfor traditionally maligned species (e.g. bats, sharks, vultures, wolves, and coyotes), \\nespecially wolves and coyotes. The two latter animals may have had increasing contact \\nwith humans during that interval. Nonetheless, the overall correlation for the 26 spe-\\ncies in common with those ranked by Kellert was .95 [17].\\nNot every moderator uncovered by Paulhus and Dean [8] has been followed up. \\nBut there is good reason to believe that several others are likely to replicate. One is the \\nage of the animal. When the authors added younger animals to the list, the blanket \\nadvantage for humans was compromised. Preference for younger patterns extended to  \\n(a) cats vs. kittens, and (b) deer vs. fawns. Empathic preference for younger ver sions \\nis consistent with the pronounced sympathy for the suffering of human children \\nover adults [18]. The youth effect is so strong that some raters felt more empa thy for \\n3 Our earlier study was acknowledged by Kellert [6]. An even earlier study by Bart [15] was less than \\nsystematic.'),\n",

It is not clear whether all younger-older compari-\\nsons would show the same pattern. Finally, direct comparisons of empathy for human \\ngroups with animal species are few and unclear in the outcome. Some writers feel that \\nsuch comparisons are logically incoherent [20].\\nNonetheless, it is evident that empathy for other human beings is not unlimited. \\nConsider the widespread support for corporal and capital punishment in many \\ncountries. And mass warfare against international enemies certainly supports the \\nlikelihood that empathy for other human animals can easily be nullified by ingroup-\\noutgroup animosity. In fact, blatant cruelty toward other humans is a strong motiva-\\ntor for some individuals [21, 22]. Even more perplexing is the human capability of \\nbeing empathic to some and cruel to others.\\n4. Unpacking the drivers\\nAs noted earlier, Paulhus and Dean [8] uncovered several characteristics con-\\ntributing independently to human empathy for animals. Statistical independence of \\nthe ‘Big Four’ (intelligence, size, esthetic appeal, and harmfulness) was ensured by \\nthe authors’ choice of scaling method (MDPREF). Here, I draw on the subsequent \\nliterature to confirm the impact of each of these four drivers.\\n1. Pe\\n\\x13 ceived intelligence: Attributions of intelligence seem tightly linked to attribu-\\ntions of sentience (i.e., self-awareness and consciousness). A centuries-old claim \\nis that animals in a slaughterhouse suffer little because they are unaware of their \\nimpending death. Inmates on death row , by contrast, are well-aware of immi-\\nnent danger. In short, empathy attributions are undoubtedly linked to perceived \\n similarity to humans, that is, anthropomorphism [23].\\n2. Size: Although commonly found [24, 25], this empathy driver has rarely been \\nsupported by rational arguments. The heuristic at work seems to be that larger \\nanimals must feel more pain— perhaps because their nervous systems are \\nmore elaborate or they have more pain receptors, or perhaps because their pain \\n reactions are so apparent?\\n3. Esthetic appeal: As with judging humans [26], physical attractiveness 4 seems to \\nconfer a positive halo that enhances empathy for animals [24, 27, 28]. The higher \\nempathy awarded to butterflies over caterpillars is a telling example, after all, they \\nare the same species at different stages of their lifespan [8].\\n4. Harmfulness: When creatures are predatory and potentially harmful to hu -\\nmans (e.g., snakes and sharks), less empathy is awarded. Apparently, their \\n“misbehavior” warrants retribution. One study reported the reverse result, \\nthat is, empathy for harmful predators [28]. That result appears to ensue from \\ntheir over-inclusion of large jungle cats, which are both beautiful and harm -\\nful. Multivariate techniques are required to properly establish independent \\npredictors [16].\\n4 Although this driver is sometimes simplified to “beauty, ” it appears to cover ta ctile appeal, including soft-\\nness and fuzziness [8].'),\n",

Implications\\nEmpathy for the distress inflicted by animal abuse is a powerful emotion and \\nvirtually universal. Wilson [1] captured this sentiment under the label “biophilia. ” \\nSubsequent empirical investigations, however, have revealed more complexity. For \\nexample, the confirmation of a phyloempathic hierarchy, highlighted in this chapter, \\nhas raised a number of challenges to a simplistic view . The fact that different animal \\nspecies draw different levels of empathy requires a compromise to moral absolutism. \\nEven the most extreme animal activists hesitate to argue that stepping on ants should \\nbe condemned as harshly as bovine slaughterhouses.\\nBut can there be a practicable cutoff somewhere on the hierarchy—a way of decid-\\ning which animals merit enough empathy to “do no harm?” Note that three of the “Big \\nFour” drivers of our empathy (beauty, size, and harmfulness) have dubious connec-\\ntions with experienced pain. Only one, perceived intelligence, has some legitimacy. \\nWhy? because it is commonly assumed that our empathy for animals should track the \\nanimal’ s awareness of pain (sentience).\\nBut how to objectively determine their suffering? In some animals, we can hear \\ncries and see other signs of pain. But with others, pain signals are undetectable, or at \\nleast, ambiguous. Does the wriggling of fish indicate their suffering? The counterar-\\ngument is that reflexive behaviors (cockroaches scampering to avoid sudden light) are \\nnot foolproof pain indicators [29]. In fact, the nervous systems of some animals are \\nnot sophisticated enough to carry pain information.\\nOur evolutionary roots undoubtedly play a role in our distinctive reactions to dif-\\nferent animals [3]. But so do unique personal experiences: Traumatic encounters may \\nhave lifelong effects [30, 31]. A further complication is that individual differences \\nwithin species may be larger than previously thought [32]. Hence, easy generaliza-\\ntions about species may be specious. The pit bull that you encountered may be more \\naggressive than the one that I encountered.\\n6. Limitations and future directions\\nThe assumption underlying this chapter is that clarification of our empathy \\nprocesses can help us decide on how animals should be treated. However, not all \\ncommentators agree that empathic reactions should be paramount in such decision-\\nmaking (e.g., [25, 33]). This view is consistent with a new wave of skepticism about \\nusing empathy as the ultimate arbiter of any decision-making (e.g. [34]). Instead, the \\nalternatives favor more objective and utilitarian approaches.5\\nThis alternative perspective opens up other contentious issues. Does suffering \\ninflicted by other animals affect us as much as suffering inflicted by humans? In fact, the \\ncorrelation between human and animal empathy is modest at the trait level. Shocking to \\nsome viewers is increased media coverage of animal-on-animal predation and aggres -\\nsion. When viewed objectively, it appears that the latter behavior is more horrifying \\n(e.g. animals being eaten alive; dogfighting). Do those who experience distress at animal \\nabuse show the same concern for animals that are victims of other animals?\\nOf course, none of these complexities excuse overt animal abuse by humans \\n[36], even if such abuse is limited to the most malevolent human personalities [37]. \\nNonetheless, it is unclear how cultural, gender, and educational differences are to \\n5 Currently, the recent edited book by Sueur et\\xa0al.

Introduction\\n1.1 Empathy in teacher instruction\\nTypically, teachers use information about how students are doing to gauge the \\nsuccess of their instructional strategies and reflect on their own experience during \\nteaching [1].

It affects lesson planning, in-class strategies, and the evaluation process. \\nFocusing on teachers’ actions and habits reveals teachers’ underlying work assump-\\ntions about their joint work with students, and it allows learning the transformation \\nof the habitual way students can use while learning [3]. As Singer and Lamm [4] have \\nargued, being “social animals” enables us to not only communicate and interact with \\neach other in effective and pleasant ways, but also to predict the actions, intentions, \\nand feelings of others. Relying on this predictive type of insight activates empathy. \\nHence, focusing on affective communication could be an efficient way for teacher \\neducators (TEs) to learn from and about their preservice teachers (PSTs)’ affective \\nstates and attitudes, enhance their reflective and empathic in-class practices, and \\nenable them to provide feedback that is better targeted to the group’ s needs during \\neducational interactions [5]. In turn, by consciously observing the teacher educators’ \\nmodeling behavior, PSTs will learn to help their future students understand what \\ndetermines their affective empathic responses and develop and maintain cognitive \\nempathic abilities as well [6].\\n1.2 Teaching chemistry\\nOver the last several years, educators involved in teaching chemistry have been \\nwondering what kinds of changes need to be integrated into the curricula [7–9] \\nand into the pedagogies in this field [10–12], to cater to learners in the twenty-first \\ncentury, and era characterized by frequent changes and uncertainty. One of the ma jor \\nquestions that need to be addressed is how to harness students’ curiosity and moti-\\nvates them to pursue a course of studies in chemistry [13].\\n1.3 Curiosity for learning\\nCuriosity is often described as the desire to seek and experience new stimuli [14]. \\nTeachers can demonstrate to their students the relevance of the topics studied and \\nthus create interest and pique their curiosity. This can be done by developing stu-\\ndents’ future-oriented skills and/or their intellectual abilities [15, 16]. By developing \\nstudents’ curiosity regarding this field, the studies can encourage them to ask them-\\nselves questions and take responsibility for their learning and, as a result, increase \\ntheir motivation to learn and their achievements [17–19]. An interesting approach is \\nthe use of uncertainty as a teaching tool to develop learners’ curiosity, thus disassoci-\\nating from a negative affect. In this manner, uncertainty is leveraged in the learning \\nprocess as a way of developing and encouraging curiosity [20].\\n1.4 Learning styles\\nTo harness the curiosity of learners with different learning styles, teachers need to \\nintegrate a variety of teaching methods to make the learning environment appealing. \\nThere are various definitions for learning styles; as mentioned in Brown, the term \\nrefers to the way individuals receive and process information in a learning context \\n[21]. Different students learn differently: some are visual learners while others are \\nauditory or kinesthetic learners. Some students are apt to prefer one learning style \\nover others, whereas others may enjoy a combination of various learning styles. \\nConsequently, it is important that teachers engage the students and pique their'),\n",

Students who learn better visually will benefit from the use of pictures or \\nvisual representations. Those who prefer auditory learning are likely to benefit from \\nreading or listening to a text being read. For kinesthetic learners, the optimal condi-\\ntions for learning involve physical interaction with the environment [23].\\n1.5 Visual learning in the sciences\\nThe use of visual models can facilitate learning in various ways: it helps in \\nproblem-solving, can serve to close gaps in students’ epistemic knowledge, and help \\nconstruct and/or convey knowledge [24, 25]. Visual representations can help intro-\\nduce information, as in visual scene through microscope, or help in the development \\nof an idea, as in the use of the double helix by Watson and Crick. It can also dem-\\nonstrate connections and concepts, as an example of sound waves [25, 26]. Hence, \\nvisual representations and models have a critical role in the learning as well as in the \\ndevelopment of science [27].\\nModels constitute a simpler representation of the target of the discussion. This \\ntarget can be an object, a material, a phenomenon, or a process [28]. When preparing \\na visual representation of any target, it must be assumed that there are similarities \\nbetween the model and the target that create a parallelism, although there are also dif-\\nferences. The main role of visual representations is to clarify meaning by describing \\nthe target. Representations and models are not a precise way to develop and examine \\nan idea. As a result, models provide an efficient and convenient mode of communica-\\ntion among scientists in the field of chemistry [29].\\n1.6 Teaching the citric acid cycle\\nTeaching biochemistry concepts can be a challenging task, as it requires learners \\nand teachers to integrate abstract processes and concepts from both chemistry and \\nbiology. Students struggle to grasp these molecular and cellular processes as they find \\nit difficult to imagine and visualize them [30, 31].\\nGlycolysis and the citric acid cycle (or Krebs cycle) ( Figure 1) are major \\naspects in the process of cellular respiration. Students usually find it difficult to \\nunderstand the chemical processes involved [32], because these include several \\nstages that take place sequentially. While the glycol lysis is a multistaged process, \\nthe citric acid cycle is cyclical and includes 10 reactions and several enzymes that \\nperform the chemical processes in the cell. Consequently, teachers seek approaches \\nand a variety of creative strategies to teach these processes to twenty-first-century  \\nlearners [33–35].\\n1.7 Peer learning\\nPeer learning is a way of learning (also referred to as peeragogy) that claims that \\nlearners are given an opportunity to practice knowledge sharing, responsibility, and \\npower [36]. Peer learning is important because in contrast to the teacher is an expert \\nin a given field, students are expert learning, and therefore, it is natural that they \\nshould be able to assist other learners in the same situation [37]. Shared learning is \\neffective for internationalizing knowledge, promoting problem-solving, and struc -\\nturing knowledge [38, 39]. However, in the process of shared learning, there are also \\nlimitations and challenges related to the variety of opinions among students and to'),\n",

In \\nthese situations, teachers play an extremely important role in monitoring and stimu -\\nlating the types of interactions between students that will promote learning [41, 42].\\n1.8 Computer-supported collaborative learning\\nComputer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) is a research-based peda-\\ngogical theory. Using CSCL may help encourage and promote collaborative peer \\nlearning, because the technology supports the sharing of ideas and encourages social \\ninteraction [43].\\nPeer learning requires precise accompanying actions on the part of the teacher; \\nhence, choosing to use CSCL to promote peer learning has certain advantages. The use \\nof a technological environment allows the teacher to follow the interactions among \\nthe students and thus target the pedagogical strategies used by each group according \\nto the group’ s needs [44]. Although during peer learning, the teacher is not the sole \\nsource of information used to construct knowledge; nevertheless, the teacher has \\nother critical roles in guiding the peer learning process [41].\\nThe following research questions were formulated:\\na. How did the PSTs perceive their responses to this CSCL model and its related \\nactivities?\\nb.

Methodology\\n2.1 The action research paradigm\\nAction research plays an important role in improving educational practices. It \\nrequires analysis and change on both the individual and the group level [45]. Kemmis \\nand colleagues [46] defined such participatory action as a joint commitment of \\nall parties involved to engage in iterative cycles of collaborative planning, acting, \\nobserving, and reflecting, intended to address positive and negative inadvertent \\nconsequences of practices. A new focus on action research in the field of science \\neducation, which was recently introduced by Burmeister and Eilks [47], draws a con-\\nnection between action research and teachers’ professional development. Specifically, \\ntheir study shifted the focus of action research in science education from curriculum \\ndevelopment to teachers’ continuous professional development by making action \\nresearch a self-reflective endeavor. Thus, to promote their professional development, \\nuniversity teacher educators are now encouraged to perform action research on their \\nown practices [48]. The focus of this type of self-reflective qualitative research is on \\nthe actions, thoughts, and feelings of the research participants [49].\\nIn the current study, the participants were the first author in the role of TE, the \\nsecond author in the role of the critical friend (CF), and a digital pedagogy counselor \\n(DPC), whose role was to supervise the CSCL implementation. These three consti-\\ntuted the educational team. The remaining participants were the 13 PSTs who were \\nenrolled in a course taught by the TE. The aim of the study was to answer the follow -\\ning question: How did the TE experience and perceive:\\na. her activities involving the CSCL pedagogy,\\nb. the PSTs’ responses to said activities, and\\nc. the contribution of the process to her professional development as a TE?\\nBased on Laudonia and colleagues’ modes of action research [50], the focus of this \\nstudy was on researching a specific “knowledge-generating” action, which consti-\\ntuted an innovation that the TE’ s introduced into her classroom setting. The purpose \\nwas to conduct a process that demands a collaborative style involving reciprocity, \\ncommitment, and the involvement of all participants. This collaborative learning \\nwith colleagues aims to rethink and reframe practices, an activity that takes on added \\nsignificance for the continued development of the TE [47].\\nAction research is regarded as a practitioner-oriented inquiry into participants’ \\nwork [51]; hence, in the current context, it required the PSTs’ involvement [52], as \\nwell as the involvement of the professional team members, who shared the responsi-\\nbility for the TE’ s professional development [53]. Lessons learned from each change \\nwere addressed in the coming weekly meeting.\\n2.2 Ethical issues\\nThe TE was personally responsible for the teaching process, the PSTs, and the \\naction research. At the same time, she sought to explore the development of the \\ncourse, as well as her professional contribution as a TE. In a similar vein, the PSTs who \\nagreed to take part in the research described the problems and challenges during the'),\n",

Results\\n3.1 Time is running out: what will the students retain from the course?\\nThe discomfort experienced by the teacher educator (TE) was based on her earlier \\nacquaintance with this group of students, who had attended her courses in chemistry \\nover a 2-year period. However, despite this previous acquaintance, the learning was \\nnot progressing at the quality or rate that the TE had set for the class and the material \\nwas not being sufficiently internalized by the students. As a result, the TE determined \\nthat the group needed to be addressed using the different teaching method. Her aspi-\\nration to involve the students in the course material is evident in the sentence written \\nin her journal after the first lesson: “I want the students to ‘fall in love’ with protein. ” \\nIn an attempt to make the learning experience more significant, the TE identified the \\nneed to create a sense of social involvement among the students, as such involvement \\ntakes the form of a collaborative learning community, which is known to promote \\nreflective thinking and learning particularly in a CSCL context [54].\\nTo this end, the TE presented a task which required each student to select a protein \\nor a biochemical reaction and study it and present it to one’ s peers in class. After a few \\nweeks, although the students had already completed this assignment, the TE recorded \\nher sense of discomfort in her journal:\\nThey still are not showing signs of curiosity or interest in the [chemical] reaction. Their \\nlearning is technical and I have not identified any desire to create a change that will lead \\nto in-depth and significant learning. I feel like our time is running out: we are nearing the \\nmiddle of the course and then the departure of the students are about to graduate. Which \\nassignment from this course will they take with them and remember later on?\\nIndeed, this assessment was accurate, as at approximately the same time frame, \\nStudent F described her experience thus: “when I was learning about the GPCR pro-\\ntein, I didn’t discover anything special about it. ” Therefore, while preparing to teach \\nthe topic of cell respiration, which is known to be a complex and time-consuming seg-\\nment of the curriculum [32], the TE was deliberating how to lead the students to gain \\na strong understanding of the topic. “The process of cell respiration is a prolonged \\none includes many stages and am wondering what is relevant and what is appropriate \\nfor our students. How can I encourage self-study skills that will lead to significant \\nlearning, when students are having difficulty ‘seeing’ the processes?”\\nIn the weekly meeting with the group, the TE came up with the idea to use ICT \\napplications as a possible tool for guiding the preservice teachers [55], using the \\nframework of CSCL, which allows for visual conceptualization and is based on \\nlearners’ collaborative work [56]. The TE demonstrated the use of the CACOO  tool \\nas a means of representing a chemical reaction: “If we write each reaction by using a \\nsquare to represent the substrate, a triangle to represent an enzyme, and perhaps we \\nshould also use colors (?), I think that could be fun … much like playing a game. ” In \\nfact, studies have indicated that also in the sciences, games can serve as a means to \\nmotivate learning [57].'),\n",

The \\nrepresentation was done in a traditional fashion, although the glucose was represented \\nby a symbol. I used symbols that are familiar to the students and showed the develop-\\nment of the process using terminology that is familiar to them. My goal was to enable \\nthem to follow the process and get involved by using the new tool.\\nBased on the TE’ s record of the students’ responses, it appears that they found \\nthe process complicated and difficult to follow: “I could tell that the process seems \\ncomplicated to them, but I was not worried that they word find it more difficult than \\nother comparable processes. ” One of the students said, “For me, following this chemi-\\ncal process is very difficult … Why aren’t we using a regular visual presentation?”\\nGiven that it was necessary “To establish thematic patterns in order to pict ure the \\nnetwork of relationships among the meanings of key terms related to the process [58], \\nthe TE explained to the group that from the next lesson onward, the students would \\nwork in pairs and would use the tool themselves to learn about other similar chemical \\nprocesses. ”\\n3.2 Guided peer learning: carefully testing the waters\\nThe first stage in learning about the citric acid cycle was based on guided peer \\nlearning.\\nPeer learning is a pedagogical strategy with many benefits, such as aiding students \\nto take responsibility on their own learning [59]. The TE presented the citric acid \\ncycle to the students and an analysis of the information about the various reactions. \\nIn the weekly team meeting, the TE described her feeling of missing the point, \\nbecause she continued to act as a source of information rather than as a facilitator or \\ncoach who encourages student-centered learning [60]. This was manifested in her \\npresenting the information already analyzed and processed so as to ease the demand \\non the students. “In an attempt to help the students cope with the English language, \\nI prepared a Hebrew translation of all 10 reactions; it was like bringing in a textbook \\n[to be memorized]. ” The TE further explained to the students that there is a cyclical \\nrelationship among the various reactions: “I explained that it is a cyclical process \\nand that each reaction continues … ‘What comes next?’—they asked, and I answered \\nmysteriously ‘that’ s for me to know and for you to find out’ . ” According to the TE, her \\nintent was to create a sense of curiosity to encourage learning [20].\\nIn the lessons that follow , the TE observed the work of the pairs in the classroom and \\nsummarized her observation in her journal: “I saw that the pair of students, M and A had \\nadopted well to this type of work. They immediately sat down to work and began reading  \\nabout the reaction from information retrieved from the Internet, calling me for from \\ntime to time to answer their question or to explicate a concept. It was obvious that they \\nwere managing well both with the tool and with the chemical reactions. ” Varying the \\nteaching methodologies was important, to address various learning styles and to make \\nthe learning interactive. While using a textbook is suitable to auditory learners, the use of \\nemoji and visual representation corresponds to the style of visual learners [61].\\nIn the weekly team meeting, the TE expressed satisfaction as you noted that each \\nof the pairs had read the explanation about the assigned reaction and acted intuitively \\nas they jointly used the CACOO.

I found them working at various \\nlevels, deeply engaged in the learning process. ” The TE noticed that student N was \\ntruly delving into the material: “The pair N and S were able to understand the reaction \\nwith the help of the video-clip; they could see that the succinate molecule turns into \\nfumarate. I could tell that N was truly pleased, perhaps even demonstrating creative \\nenthusiasm, like a child eager to use a new set of crayons.

The key is the enzyme that opens the briefcase, what do you say?”\\nBy contrast, the pair of students F and D did not find the video clips helpful and \\nstill found it difficult to focus on the reaction they were assigned to study: “F and \\nD looked lost … Even with the video-clips they couldn’t figure out what they were \\nsupposed to do. ” At one point, they turned to the TE and said: “We haven’t succeeded \\nin understanding any of it; we can’t do anything. This is the second lesson we are \\nspending on this task. ”\\nIn the team’ s weekly meeting, it was suggested that the TE had not yet reached \\nthe stage needed to change the essence of her role as teacher, as [64] described it: \\n“Transitioning from being the instructional star to being the director of learning. ” \\nAt the same time, however, the TE’ s feelings of empathy were deepening, as she \\ndescribed it: “I sat down next to them, looked at them, and said ‘it must be very disap-\\npointing not to succeed on the second try … What can be done about this?’” Student \\nF asked “How do the other pairs manage?” I redirected the question back at them: “I \\ndon’t know . That’ s a good question. What do you think?” At this point I was thinking \\nof offering them a chance to look at the work of the other pairs, but decided not to \\nsay anything. I felt that they did not need another piece of advice from me; the only \\nneeded me listen. I could see them staring again and again at the video-clips, without \\nmanaging to decipher the reaction. ” The students’ repeated attempts and the frustra-\\ntion they experienced due to their lack of success led the TE to sense that what they \\nneeded was someone to listen and be attentive to them [65], rather than an additional \\nexplanation regarding the assignment.\\n3.4 With a little help from my friends\\nThe TE felt the need to find a different approach.

At this stage, the TE could \\nencourage peer learning and peer assessment. Asking for help from peers often \\nencourages students to practice self-regulatory skills such as self-reflection [66]. The  \\nTE’ s goal for the next lesson was to bring the students to understand the connections \\nbetween the reactions and the meaning of a biochemical cycle. “I mentioned in the \\nclass that they should not forget that there is a cycle of connections between the \\nreactions. Within a few moments they began to discuss this and explore each other’ s \\nwork. ” In her journal, the TE noted: “Perhaps this can be a way to help F and D?”\\nSoon enough, using the CACOO synchronous-collaborative tool, the students \\nbegan discussing the connections among the reactions and observing each other’ s'),\n",

It occurred to them that they had to relate to the reactions described by the \\nother pairs, that it was all part of a single puzzle. The pairs began to compare their \\nwork. An open and flowing discussion developed. “They began to discuss the emoji’ s \\nused to represent those molecules: How does it all come together?’ Even though I had \\nrepeatedly reminded them that this was a biochemical cycle, they were not ready to \\nunderstand its significance—up until this point, that is!”\\nIn the next team meeting, the TE described the social interaction that developed, \\nwhich was mediated by the use of the same digital tool. “Just like in a chemical reac-\\ntion, in which each substance has a role, but each pair had produced formed part of \\nthe final product. And it is important to note that the pair that was having the most \\ndifficulty no longer had to cope alone. As student D said, ‘I finally understood what \\nthe TE meant. Seeing what the other pairs had made helped me understand’ . ” The TE \\nsummarized this stage in her journal: “They suddenly understood that up until now \\nthey had been working on different pieces of the same cycle. Some of them accepted \\nthe visual representation of the other couples and some adamantly opposed the \\nchoices of their classmates. But it made them try to understand the logic behind each \\nchoice, make adjustments, and redesign their visual representations. ”\\nTo gain an understanding of the chemical reactions and processes in the lesson, \\nit was important to discuss the meanings in the analogies that they had created. It is \\nevident that different students would use different analogies; however, discussing and \\nreflecting on these differences is a critical phase [29]. Without such a discussion, the \\nmain point of the learning process is missed. Given that the chemical reactions are \\nconnected to each other in the cycle, there was an echoing of the peer learning process \\n(that took place within the pairs) in the creation of the final product. As the product \\nof one reaction becomes a component of the next chemical reaction, each pair of \\nstudents must work with another pair of peers. The TE recognized this as a second \\nturning point and noted: “It was a pleasure. It was interesting to hear about their \\nexperiences . I was very excited to see them working together during that lesson. ”\\nThe pair of students, M and A, were involved in a dialog with another pair and \\nrealize that things did not work out in the cycle as they had expected, but they \\nwere inspired to continue exploring. Even though they had experience difficulty \\nin the earlier stages of the learning process, they were pleasantly challenged in a \\nlater stage. At one point, M turned to her partner and said “Look at the way S and \\nN represented the reaction; it’ s different from the way we did it. Let’ s ask them why \\nthey did it that way. ” That the most noticeable change was in the work of the pair \\nF and D, who up until this point had not understood how they could describe the \\nassigned reaction using emoji. In her journal, the TE noted the following: “They \\nbegan using the work of the other pairs like crutches. I could see their eyes light \\nup when they finally began to understand. As I passed by her, M looked directly at \\nme and smiled. I felt that the empathy that I expressed in regard to their difficulty \\nenabled us to have a sense of a shared experience, even without words. ” All of the \\npairs demonstrated significant progress after the collaborative assessment of their \\npeers’ products. This mutual reliance led them to “practice self-regulatory skills \\nsuch as self-reflection reflection” [66].\\n3.5 “The oxaloacetate went straight to my heart”: completing the cycle (together)\\nAfter establishing a social infrastructure that led to shared learning, the next stage \\nwas to recognize the connections among the various parts in the cycle and to “Taylor” \\nthe transitions between the reactions to render a group product.

Will this become an issue? \\nHow will they arrive at a joint solution?” The CF noted the importance of the issue \\nis an opportunity to discuss the universality of scientific language. As it turned out, \\nall of the students agreed that using the picture of a lemon helped remind them of \\nthe citric acid reaction ( Table 1): “Jokingly, one of the students acknowledged their \\nshared understanding, as she added a lemon to the emoji representing the citric acid. \\nThis put in motion the task for that lesson, which was to understand the citric acid \\ncycle as a complete process. ” The social interactions related to the topic at hand were \\nextremely important for creating a collaborative learning process [43]. Also in the \\ncase of representing the fumarate (see Table 1 for the two options the two different \\ngroups suggested for fumarate. The students agreed on option 1), all of the students \\nagreed on the creative symbol selected by N, who explained her choice to her peers. \\nThe TE recorded the student’ s explanation in her journal:\\n“This is a trans molecule, you see? [She points to the double bond], so then I think of it as \\ntransgender. ” Her classmates laughed. I told him that was a unique and original idea but \\nasked if they knew the etymology of the word transgender. They did not, so I explained \\nthat it means “someone whose gender-related feelings do not correspond to the sex they \\nwere born with and, thus, the heavy atoms around the double bond points in two differ -\\nent directions, whereas cisgender is the term used when the individual’s feelings coincide \\nwith the sex one is born with, and thus in chemistry, cis refers to a molecule in which \\nheavy atoms around the double bond points in the same direction. ” I could tell that they \\nenjoy the explanation on the representation selected for that molecule.\\nHearing this explanation was pleasing to the students because it enabled them \\nto understand the deeper meaning of the term “transgender. ” From a sociocultural \\nperspective, education is concerned also with linguistic changes, whereby older words \\nacquire new meanings. This aspect became part of the process of learning the lan-\\nguage of chemistry [67].\\nIn contrast to the last two examples on which students were quick to agree abou t \\nthe symbol chosen, in other cases, they found it difficult to come to an agreement. \\nEach pair had an explanation and rationale for choosing a particular emoji and the \\nfact that their choice also gave meaning to the chemical reaction made it a source of \\ndisagreement. This stage, the TE opted to refrain from intervening. Explaining their \\nrationale was important for understanding the topic at hand. “It was the right moment \\nto allow the learners to present their ideas and explain them, which is a necessary \\npart in the process of constructing knowledge. I feel that I am ready to let go [of my \\ncentral role] and instead I can stand aside and observe the learning process. ” During \\nthe weekly team meeting, the CF noted the important development whereby the TE \\ntransitioned from the role of initiator to functioning as an instructional manager \\n[64]. In contrast to the earlier stage when disagreement or conflict was a source of \\ndiscomfort for the TE, she now recognized that these could be a possible resource for \\nsocial interaction that contributes to the cognitive organization of the newly acquired \\nknowledge [68].\\nIn the case of a particular disagreement regarding the symbol selected to represent \\nsuccinyl CoA, the TE did intervene (see Table 1 for the two options the two different \\ngroups suggested for succinyl CoA): “Look, we managed to come to an agreement \\non one representation, the transgender.

Discussion\\nLife in the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution is dynamic and constantly \\nchanging, and the task of teaching must adapt to the shifts that are characteristic of \\nthis era. Considering the future of high school graduates who are currently in the edu-\\ncation system, we realize that they must be able to practice and adapt to conditions \\nof uncertainty. To this end, and according to the OECD (Organization for Economic \\nCo-operation and  Development) [69], they need to acquire a broad range of skills, \\namong them cognitive skills (e.g. critical thinking, creative thinking, and the ability to \\nself-regulate), social and emotional skills (e.g. empathy and teamwork skills), as well \\nas practical skills (e.g. using ICT -mediated information).\\nTo educate graduates who correspond to this description, teachers are tasked with \\nthe important responsibility of listening to and developing their students’ skills. \\nHence, not only must these aspects of teacher responsibility be addressed in the \\nformal curricula of teacher education, but they should be emphasized and discussed \\nin the early stages of the program before these learners begin to practice their teach-\\ning skills in the classroom.\\nIn the current study, we discussed the learning process for acquiring knowledge \\non a topic that is considered particularly complex and difficult.

The incorporation \\nof CSCL in the case presented here demonstrates the way a teacher can promote the \\ndevelopment of learners’ cognitive and practical skills in a manner that corresponds \\nto the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.\\nIn cognitive terms, the learners had to cope with complex concepts, which many \\nstudents find difficult. Teachers are typically aware that teaching this subject mat-\\nter in a manner that is helpful to students requires the use of a variety of learning \\napproaches and strategies. In the case described here, students had to develop critical \\nthinking as they studied complex chemical reactions. They needed to employ creative \\nthinking because they were required to analyze the text that they read and the audio \\nsegment that they had heard and translate this information into a visual representa-\\ntion of their design. They were also required to manage their learning process inde-\\npendently, despite the difficulty in challenging nature of the assignment.\\nIn practical terms, the learners were introduced to a new and hence unfamiliar \\ndigital tool and learned to use it simultaneously with their team members in a col-\\nlaborative learning process, intended to promote the shared acquisition of knowledge. \\nIt would be interesting to further investigate the potential social and emotional skills \\nthat were developed and used in the course of this learning process.\\n4.1 Teacher empathy beyond CSCL skills\\nIn the course of planning the task and analyzing its development in the weekly \\nteam meetings, the DPC and the CF attempted to address the manner in which the \\nTE could emphasize the aspect of social and emotional skills. However, the TE was \\nunprepared to introduce these aspects into her teaching. In contrast to the develop-\\nment of cognitive and practical skills, which was strongly emphasized in her lessons, \\nit appears that the TE’ s approach was not oriented toward the social and emotional \\naspects. However, in light of the findings of the current study, a different picture \\nemerged. The TE understood the orientation that the PC and CF were encouraging \\nher to incorporate realized that the process seemed to be stuck or reached a dead end, \\nthe unconscious solution that she chose was to use empathy. The team discovered \\nthat empathy as an educational approach is the option she typically chooses to use \\nwhen helping her students. At the stage when her students were struggling, she first \\nturned to solutions that promoted the development of their cognitive or practical \\nskills. Perhaps a more precise and appropriate solution would have been to purposely \\nraise questions related to social-emotional skills? Given that the TE was guiding the \\nlearning process of preservice teachers, perhaps the situation called for a more direct \\nand open discussion of these aspects in the lesson?\\nFollowing the interview that the CF held with the TE, the CF emphasized that \\nalthough the use of empathy as a strategy for coping with students’ difficulties was \\nintroduced only when nothing else worked, it was nonetheless an important tool in \\nher teaching process. Its importance can be seen in the interactions with the pair of \\nstudents F and D, who required her empathy and support throughout the process, \\nas the cognitive and practical learning strategies were less effective for this pair of \\nstudents. Another example of the importance of this empathic approach can be found \\nin the process of the class discussion, when working on the final product and negoti-\\nating which symbols should be used. Steering this discussion was not an easy task for \\nthe TE. For the students, as well as for the TE, this was a peak point in the learning'),\n",

The focus of the discussion was on which \\nviewpoint each pair employed to facilitate their understanding of the subject matter. \\nAfter the process of working together and analyzing the particular chemical reac-\\ntion, some pairs found it difficult to give up their viewpoint in favor of that used by \\na different pair. This created an opportunity to conduct a discussion that was highly \\nsocial and emotional. After analyzing the findings of this study, the TE felt that this \\nopportunity was not fully used for the purpose of addressing social-emotional aspects \\nfor directly addressing the use of empathy as a teaching tool. As a result, the TE is now \\nmore aware of the importance of developing social-emotional skills in general and \\nempathy as an educational tool to be used in the classroom, especially when teaching \\ncomplicated topics.\\n5. Summary\\nThe importance of incorporating and discussing models in the teaching of chemis-\\ntry is well known [29]. Scientists use models to compare their product with the target \\nand find similarities and differences. This process can take the form of an empiric \\nexamination or a thought experiment. Teachers tend to use analogical models to com-\\npare the target with concrete objects and events that are familiar to the students from \\ntheir everyday lives. In the case described in the current study, the modeling process \\nincluded the task of independently designing the molecules and chemical reactions \\ninvolved in the citric acid cycle. The advantage of this approach was in assigning the \\nstudents the task of creating a model that would be helpful and meaningful to them. \\nA possible disadvantage of this approach was that some of the representations that \\nwere created would not be clear or meaningful to learners outside of this particular \\ngroup. Student R understood this shortcoming and expressed her feelings, stating \\nthat in her view , the constricted significance of the representations selected made the \\nlearning superficial.\\nThe TE also felt that this issue should have been considered and discussed, as it is \\nparticularly significant for learners who are PSTs: What is the significance of a model \\nthat is not comprehensible to those outside the group that created? Is an educational \\nprocess that renders a product that cannot be understood by those outside the par-\\nticular group still meaningful or significant? Is the teaching of science different in this \\nsense from teaching other disciplines? These are questions that the TE felt should have \\nbeen addressed in the classroom.'),\n",

Empathy is perceived to be a people-related \\ncapability that forms part of a Developmental H-PC factor, which operationalises the \\ndemocratic style of leadership. It is argued that Empathy contributes to leadership \\neffectiveness through multi-dimensional thinking, win-win alliance formation, high-\\nperformance team working and the creation of organic organisational structures. It is \\nsuggested that four major challenges, including the resolution of humanity’ s greatest \\nchallenges, require leaders to have Empathy as a strength. Data are presented that \\nindicate Empathy, and other key H-PC, are underdeveloped in modern leaders, which \\nsuggests a significant reorientation of leadership development is required.\\nKeywords: competency, leadership, complexity, democracy, dictatorship,  \\nhigh-performance teams\\n1. Introduction\\nWhat characteristics do good leaders have? The question has been debated \\nthroughout human history as Xenophon’ s “The Education of Cyrus” [1] and Suetonius’ \\n“How to be a Bad Emperor” [2] testify. In modernity, particularly since World War \\nTwo, the question has been addressed empirically. One strand of international \\nresearch has focused on learnable leadership behaviours that raise organisational per -\\nformance. This strand has identified 11 High-Performance Competencies (H-PC) that \\nare classified into four factors: Thinking, Achieving, Developmental, and Directional. \\nThe Thinking and Achieving clusters are seen as task-oriented behaviours, while the \\nDevelopmental and Directional clusters are considered people-oriented (see Tables \\n1 and 2). Empathy, which has had several labels including ‘Interpersonal Search’ and \\n‘Perceptual Objectivity’ , is one of three behaviours in the Developmental cluster. The \\nchapter explores the history, definition, use and importance of Empathy as a H-PC.\\nThe chapter suggests that Empathy contributes to leadership effectiveness through \\nmulti-dimensional thinking, win-win alliance formation, high performance team -\\nworking and the creation of organic organisational structures. It is suggested that four \\nmajor challenges, including the resolution of humanity’ s greatest challenges, require \\nleaders to have strengths in Empathy. Finally, data is presented that indicate Empathy, \\nand other key H-PC, are underdeveloped in leaders, which suggests a significant \\nreorientation of leadership development is required.'),\n",

First, the origins of Empathy in modern \\nleadership behaviour research are traced; this results in a definition of Empathy \\nand its detailed specification via a five-point behaviourally anchored rating scale. \\nSecond, H-PC assumptions about Empathy are explored. The third section considers \\nEmpathy’ s interaction with other H-PC’ s, while the fourth explores Empathy’ s role in \\nhigh performance team development. Fifthly, Empathy’ s current and future impor-\\ntance is considered. Finally, conclusions are drawn.\\n2. The origins, definition, and specification of empathy as a H-PC\\nEmpathy has been explored by four streams of leadership research into learnable \\nbehaviours that may be associated with superior organisational performance: (i) \\nInitiating Structure and Consideration; (ii) Transformational Leadership Theory; \\n(iii) Behavioral Complexity Theory; and (iv) Managerial Competencies. The findings \\nof these four streams in relation to Empathy are summarized below .\\ni. Initi\\n\\x1a ting structure and consideration researchers in this stream include \\nBales\\xa0[3], Hemphill [4], Likert [5], Stodgill [6] and, Fleishman et al. [7]. \\nThe Consideration dimension encompasses several empathetic behaviours \\nincluding: (a) listening to and understanding the ideas, feelings, needs \\nand goals of subordinates; (b) using summaries to test own understanding \\nof others’ ideas; (c) giving group members ample opportunity to express \\ntheir own perspective; and (d) leaders asking for opinions and sugges-\\ntions. The meta-analysis of Judge et al. [8] found a significant positive \\nrelationship between Consideration and leadership performance indices.\\nii. Transformational leadership theory has been widely propounded and  \\ndiscussed—most especially by House [9], Burns [10] and, Bass [11].  \\nThe ‘Individualized Consideration’ dimension of this theory describes  \\nDomain Factor Competency\\nTask Thinking Information Search\\nConcept Formation\\nConceptual Flexibility\\nAchieving Proactive Orientation\\nAchievement Orientation\\nPeople Developmental Empathy\\nManaging Interaction\\nDevelopmental Orientation\\nDirectional Impact\\nSelf-confidence\\nPresentation\\nTable 1.  \\nH-PC domains, factors and competencies.'),\n",

Based on these findings, H-PC researchers have formally \\ndefined Empathy as follows:\\n‘ A set of learnable behaviours (including the use of open and probing questions, \\nsummaries and paraphrasing) that enable an individual to accurately and non-judg-\\nmentally understand the ideas, feelings, motives, goals, perspectives and mind-sets \\nof\\xa0others. ’\\nTo accurately and reliably measure the observed empathetic skill of individu -\\nals, H-PC researchers devised a five-point behaviorally anchored rating scale \\nfor Empathy—see Table 3. Training and certification programmes show that \\nthe Empathy Rating Scale, like those for the other 10 H-PC, enables assessors \\nto achieve very high levels of reliability; to pass the H-PC accreditation test, a \\ntrainee’ s ratings must show a minimum of 80% concordance with verified expert \\nratings.\\nHaving described the origins of Empathy as a H-PC and presented the defini-\\ntion and rating scale used by researchers in this field, the next section explores the \\nassumptions this research stream makes about the nature of Empathy.\\n3. H-PC assumptions about the nature of empathy\\nIn H-PC research, Empathy is considered an interpersonal skill that enables \\nindividuals to comprehend accurately the conceptions of others; to see the inner and \\nouter worlds of another, or some aspect of them, ‘through that person’ s eyes’ . The per-\\nceptions of others, it is assumed, may be very different to one’ s own, so comprehen-\\nsion requires considerable empathetic skill. That skill includes being non-evaluative \\nfor two reasons at least. First, evaluation involves the imposition of one’ s own judge-\\nments on the perceptions of another, which makes accurately understanding those \\nperceptions extremely difficult, if not impossible. Second, when people experience \\nevaluation, whether it be verbal or non-verbal, they tend to stop sharing their percep-\\ntions, which defeats the purpose of using Empathy.\\nUnderpinning Empathy is a second H-PC research assumption: that individu-\\nals perceive themselves and their environment through the conceptual schemata \\nthey have created using cognitive processes that may function unconsciously. H-PC \\nresearch is grounded in Behavioral Complexity Theory (Cockerill & Satish [21]), \\nso it emphasizes two structural cognitive processes: differentiation and integration. \\nDifferentiation refers to the number of conceptual dimensions a person uses, whilst \\nintegration refers to the way dimensions are brought together to produce an outcome \\n(such as an attitude, vision, goal, decision or plan). Whilst cultural socialization \\nresults in shared constructs, the distinctive cognitive processing (and experience) of \\nevery individual gives them unique conceptualisations, which must be elicited using \\nEmpathy if they are to be understood by another.\\nLastly, H-PC research assumes that the unique perceptions of others may be valu-\\nable; for example, they may provide new solutions, stimulate creativity and innova-\\ntion, enable better forecasting, or help mutually beneficial alliances to be forged. In \\nessence, the use of Empathy expands the cognitive space and resources leaders are \\nusing, which provides a greater potential for synergistic value creation. By leverag-\\ning this value potential, empathetic leaders increase organisational performance. In \\nessence, Empathy is an H-PC because it creates superior outcomes by expanding the \\ncognitive space and resources used by leaders.'),\n",

Empathy’ s interaction with the other H-PC’ s\\nWhilst the confirmatory factor analyses of Chorvat [22] and Guenole et al. [23] \\nindicate the 11 H-PC are independent behavioural dimensions, exploratory factor \\nanalysis and real-world experience show that structural and valuable relation-\\nships exist between the HP-C. This section explores the relations most applicable to \\nEmpathy.\\n4.1 Empathy’ s relationship with the Developmental and Directional factors\\nAt the highest level, as discussed above, the 11 H-PC can be separated into the Task \\nand People domains; the former includes 5 H-PC that subdivide into Thinking and \\nAchieving factors, whilst the latter contains 6 H-PC that split into the Developmental \\nand Directional factors – see Table 1 . Empathy, alongside Managing Interaction and \\nDevelopmental Orientation, loads on the Developmental factor in the People domain. \\nAnalysis and experience suggest the Developmental and Directional factors constitute \\ntwo different and fundamental styles of interpersonal interaction that build leader-\\nship effectiveness in distinctive ways.\\nThe Developmental factor enables leaders to function in a democratic and nurtur-\\ning way. Using this factor leaders build teams, help people to learn and grow and \\nexpand the cognitive space being utilized by encouraging others to share and under-\\nstand each other’ s perspectives. The Developmental behaviours are highly demanded \\nin organically designed organizations that require high levels of lateral integration \\nand co-operation (Burns and Stalker [24]) and in participative situations that seek \\nto foster imagination, creativity and innovation. When used in combination, the \\nDevelopmental H-PC operationalize the democratic style of leadership.\\nUsing the Directional factor leaders can function in a top-down, charismatic way \\nthat uses persuasion, decisiveness, confidence and high-impact presentations to \\ninspire people and align them with pre-determined visions, policies, decisions and \\nplans. The Directional behaviours are highly demanded in mechanistic organizations \\nthat require vertical integration and in crisis/emergency situations where clarity, \\nconfidence and rapid action are vital. When leaders use the Directional H-PC in \\ncombination, they operationalize the autocratic style of leadership.\\nIn sum, Empathy loads on the Developmental H-PC factor, which contrasts with \\nthe Directional H-PC factor. These two people-oriented H-PC factors give behavioural \\nexpression to the democratic and autocratic leadership styles that have consumed so \\nmuch attention throughout history and that vie for ascendancy in democracies and \\ndictatorships across the globe today. The former style builds lateral integration in \\norganisations and the former builds vertical integration.\\nBesides exploring H-PC relationships within factors, it is also useful to consider \\ninteractions across factors. For Empathy, the linkages it has with both Conceptual \\nFlexibility and Impact are worth highlighting, as the next section discusses.\\n4.2 Empathy and conceptual flexibility\\nConceptual Flexibility is the skill of keeping different perspectives or options \\nin mind simultaneously and evaluating their pros and cons in a balanced, unbiased \\nway. In complex situations that incorporate multiple, different perspectives, leaders \\nmust use Empathy to comprehend those viewpoints and Conceptual Flexibility to \\nkeep them in focus simultaneously.

Such decisions have a high probability of success. \\nLeaders who fail to use Empathy and Conceptual Flexibility in combination make \\nincomplete, one-sided analyses and take narrow decisions that are not based on all \\nthe viable options. Such decisions can be derailed quickly during the implementa -\\ntion phase when negative, unanticipated factors kick-in; this is particularly the \\ncase when neither Empathy nor Conceptual Flexibility have been used. Hence, in \\nreal-life, there is normally a stark difference in performance outcomes between \\nusing Empathy and Conceptual Flexibility in tandem and not doing so, especially \\nwhen the stakes are high.\\nThe prevalence of the non-combined approach was highlighted by unpublished \\nresearch conducted by the author at London Business School. 180 individuals, who \\nheld middle management positions in a variety of British-based businesses, par -\\nticipated in a two-hour, six-person, group decision making exercise. The 30 groups \\nattended over a six-month period. In the exercise, the six participants adopted the \\nrole of different functional directors in a simulated firm; they were tasked with \\ncreating an agreed strategy that would significantly improve firm performance. \\nHaving each read a different two-page brief that described issues and potential \\nsolutions from the perspective of the function they were representing, the partici -\\npants interacted as a leadership group for 90 minutes. Interdependencies between \\nfunctions in the simulated firm meant participants needed to share the salient \\ninformation contained in their functional perspectives to create optimal solutions. \\nResearchers recorded how much salient information was shared by participants \\nduring the group meeting. On average, participants shared just over 20% of the \\nsalient information – the range being five to 36%. On no occasion was sufficient \\ninformation elicited by participants via Empathy for them to build a holistic, \\noptimal solution. Instead of using Empathy and Conceptual Flexibility in combi -\\nnation, participants used the Directional H-PC; they presented and confidently \\nmade a persuasive case for their own solution; the lack of conceptual integration \\nmeant voting was used in most cases to decide the way forward.\\nWork shadowing of managers and executives by H-PC researchers and practitio-\\nners indicate the simulated results are not unrepresentative of real-life – a conclusion \\nthat is supported by the summary H-PC profile presented in Table 4. These findings \\nsuggests that sizable performance improvements are widely available if leaders learn \\nto use Empathy and Conceptual Flexibility together.\\n4.3 Empathy and Impact\\nImpact encompasses skills like the use of persuasive arguments, behaviour \\nmodelling, symbols and storytelling to influence others and gain support for ideas, \\ndecisions, strategies, plans, visions and values. Leaders skilled in Impact attract \\nresources, build momentum and gain political traction. The use of Empathy with \\nImpact takes leaders to a higher plane of effectiveness. Empathy enables leade rs to \\nunderstand the needs, desires, goals and visions of others; when leaders combine \\nthis information with the use of Impact, they forge mutually beneficial win-win \\nalliances that significantly boost organisational performance. Hence, Empathy \\nis vitally important to the many leaders who have Directional strengths because \\nit shifts them away from a narrow , top-down autocratic style to a Socialized \\nDirectional style that incorporates multi-faceted coalitions and is better suited to \\nthe modern world.'),\n",

It has been argued that the \\nDevelopmental and Directional factors provide leaders with two different styles \\nof interpersonal interaction that both have situational benefits and drawbacks. \\nFurthermore, the section has explored how leaders can synergistically use Empathy \\nin combination with other H-PCs to achieve performance gains and to reduce the \\nunilateral, one-sided character of the Directional factor. The next section explores the \\nrole Empathy plays in high-performance team development.\\n5. Empathy’ s role in high-performance team development\\nThe modern world is increasingly characterized by innovation, complexity and \\ndynamism, which raises the need for flexible, organic organisational designs and \\nmakes traditional mechanistic designs less relevant. Organic structures require \\nsome top-down vertical integration, but they rely most on lateral integration, which \\noccurs within and between organizations. Besides individuals and systems, teams \\nof various sorts (e.g., project, cross-boundary, strategy, quality control, crisis, \\nleadership) build both lateral and vertical integration and their effectiveness con -\\ntributes significantly to the performance of organic designs. As the previous section \\ndescribed, H-PC research in simulated and real-life organisations indicate that many \\nteams function sub-optimally. To help address this need, Professor H M Schroder \\nand the author designed a high-performance team development (H-PTD) methodol -\\nogy, which trains participants to use a cluster of the H-PC that includes Empathy. \\nSince its creation, H-PTD has been applied in multiple, diverse organisations across \\nthe\\xa0world. This section outlines H-PTD methodology and focuses on the role played \\nby Empathy.\\nThe origins of H-PTD can be traced to Conceptual Systems Theory (see Harvey \\net al.

In real-life, teams can, and often do, become ‘arrested’ at \\na stage, which halts progression, or they can regress from a higher to a lower stage. \\nProgression enhances the collective cognitive and interpersonal functioning of par-\\nticipants. After a review of Stage 1 (Externalizing), this section concentrates on Stage \\n2 (Sharing) because it heavily demands the use of Empathy.\\nStage 1: Externalizing. When individuals join a newly formed team, in either simu-\\nlated or real-life settings, they bring along a lifetime of experiences gained from their \\ninteraction with a variety of institutions (e.g., familial, commercial, governmental, \\nreligious and international). Hence, the character of team members has been shaped \\nby the existence and enforcement of external institutional rules – both formal (laws, \\nrules, precedents, procedures etc.) and informal (ethics, values, social norms etc.) \\n(North [26]). H-PTD calls Stage 1 ‘Externalizing’ to reflect the effect environmental \\ninstitutions have on individuals; to varying degrees, this effect manifests itself in \\nin three ways. First, team members exhibit some degree of external dependency; \\nhaving been moulded throughout their lives by external institutions, they are keen to \\ndiscover how formal and informal authority structures affect the team; for example, \\nthey seek direction, guidance, advice and resources from authority figures. Second \\nteam members tend to be conformist; they veer away from ‘rocking the boat’ – from \\nchallenging or trying the change their institutional environment. Third, team mem-\\nbers have hidden agendas; in life, they have learned it is better to keep some ambitions \\nand goals private rather than share them openly with institutional figures. The global \\napplication of H-PTD shows externalizing behaviour to be strongest in people who \\nare used to punitive, dictatorial regimes and weakest in people who live in supportive, \\nFigure 1. \\nThe stages of high-performance team development.'),\n",

Typically, the former individuals find progression through the \\nsix stages of team development more challenging so, for them, achieving high team \\nperformance is more difficult. Stage 2 of H-PTD guides team members away from \\nExternalizing behaviours and lays the foundations needed for complex analysis and \\naction.\\nStage 2: Sharing. In this stage, team members are coached in the use Empathy so \\nthey can share and understand each other’ s perspectives. This requires them to work \\nindependently of external authority in a non-conformist way and to become less reli-\\nant on hidden agendas by interacting openly with each other.\\nWorkshop participants begin Stage 2 with preparation. The trainer introduces a \\nsimulated, multi-functional business organisation; each participant adopts a different \\nfunctional director role, and the trainer explains they must work together, without \\nthe involvement of their boss (the CEO), to devise a way of significantly raising firm \\nperformance. The brief of each participant describes problems, issues and potential \\nsolutions that are apparent from her/his function’ s viewpoint. Hence, six functional \\nperspectives exist, which each describe some functional interdependencies, but \\neach participant only knows about the function s/he is representing. Ultimately, the \\nfunctional interdependencies mean that each participant must understand all six per-\\nspectives if an optimal way forward for the firm is to be created. The trainer instructs \\nparticipants to prepare a short 5-minute verbal presentation that summarizes their \\nfunctional brief.\\nWith the Stage 2 preparation phase complete, the trainer explains the following \\nempathetic procedure that participants will use to share and comprehend all six func-\\ntional viewpoints: (i) A team member, randomly selected by the trainer, will verbally \\npresent his/her functional viewpoint to the others, who will note the salient points \\nand not interrupt the speaker; (ii) When the presentation is completed, team mem-\\nbers can use open, probing and clarificatory questions to ensure they fully understand \\nthe presenter’ s perspective; no evaluations, judgements and criticisms are to be made; \\n(iii) Once the questioning is finished, the trainer will randomly choose one of the \\nteam members to summarize the presenter’ s perspective; (iv) When the summary has \\nbeen made, the presenter will verbally critique it to ensure it is totally accurate. The \\nteam members will modify their notes as necessary to ensure they are comprehensive; \\nand (v) With the first team member’ s viewpoint shared and accurately noted by all, \\nthe procedure will be repeated for the five remaining functional viewpoints.\\nBefore Stage 2 interaction starts, the trainer gives examples of appropriate \\nEmpathetic language that participants can use:\\n• During the questioning phase:\\n○ Please repeat the first issue you see facing the firm.\\n○ What factors are causing that issue?\\n○ Could you elaborate on…\\n○ I don’t understand your point about…\\n○ Could you clarify…\\n○ Is there anything you could add about…?'),\n",

In this way, each \\nparticipant contributes a perspective and elicits one from a fellow team member. \\nFacilitation involves giving feedback and coaching, so the Developmental Orientation \\nH-PC is also used and enhanced in Stage 2.\\nWhen Stage 2 is complete, each participant understands all the functional per-\\nspectives and has used Empathy to strength level. In subsequent H-PTD stages, team \\nmembers identify the deep, underlying issues that face the simulated firm before \\nthey devise and evaluate two holistic strategies to boost firm performance. They \\nthen decide the way forward and conduct a risk-reduction exercise to maximize the \\nbenefits and minimize the costs of the chosen strategy.\\nAt the end of Stage 2, team members perceive the full range of challenges facing \\nthe firm; this conceptually empowers them and reduces their dependence on exter -\\nnal authority figures for advice and guidance. In addition, team members begin to \\nrealise that conformity will lock the firm into a cycle of underperformance – espe -\\ncially as external institutions and authority figures are acting as negative constraints \\non the firm. Furthermore, the sharing of functional viewpoints in a non-judgmental \\nway encourages openness and trust, which reduces team members’ reliance on hid -\\nden agendas.\\nThe movement of a Stage 2 team away from external dependency, conformity and \\nhidden agendas can appear threatening to institutions and authority figures—espe-\\ncially if they are punitive and dictatorial. The threat level is heightened if Stage 2 team \\nmembers are critical of external authority because they now appreciate the full scale \\nof its constraining effect. For real-life teams, such circumstances mean Stage 2 can be \\nfragile because authority figures are tempted to impose controls on the team to ‘get it \\nback into line’ . When this occurs, it usually has unintended negative consequences. On \\nthe one hand, the team can regress back to Stage 1, which reduces performance and \\nmakes any subsequent progression back to Stage 2 more difficult. On the other hand, \\nteam members can rebel and try to escape from or overturn external authority – pos-\\nsibly in a revolutionary way. For these counterproductive reasons, there is a strong \\nonus on developmental agents and authority figures to accept, tolerate and support \\nStage 2 teams and encourage their progression through to the subsequent H-PTD \\nstages where negativity declines and productivity soars.\\nIn summary, the design and worldwide application of the H-PTD methodology \\nhas shown that Empathy has a vitally important role to play in building teams that \\nconsistently perform beyond normal expectations. Empathy is the bedrock of Stage 2 \\nH-PTD and it plays a vital role in this methodology’ s subsequent stages. Nevertheless, \\nit is important to recognize that the use of Empathy has consequences that can appear'),\n",

The importance of developing empathy now and in the future\\nFour major challenges mean the worldwide demand for Empathy and the other \\nteam H-PC is high. This section highlights those challenges and presents data to \\nexplore the capacity of leaders to meet them.\\nFirst, increasing global innovation, complexity and dynamism heighten the need \\nfor organically designed structures that incorporate high levels of lateral integration \\nwithin and between organisations; this, in turn, challenges leaders to build high-\\nperformance teams by using Empathy and the other H-PC in the team cluster.\\nHeightening global demand for Empathy and the team H-PC cluster derives from \\nanother source—economic growth. The research of Schiffbauer and Shen [27] is of \\ninterest here. It found that poor but stable nations with dictatorial regimes experience \\nhigher economic growth than democratic. However, beyond a threshold income level, \\nthe benefits of democratic regimes become apparent, and they outgrow dictator-\\nships. Hence, as global incomes rise, driven mainly by technological innovation (see \\nRosenberg [28]), the demand for democratic institutions rises, which encourages the \\nspread of organic organisational designs, high-performance teamworking and the \\nteam H-PC cluster, which includes Empathy.\\nThirdly, the success of the global movement towards realising human potential \\nthrough greater diversity and inclusion depends, to a significant degree, on the devel-\\nopment and use by leaders of Empathy and the other team H-PC behaviours. These \\nH-PC enable diverse viewpoints and capabilities to be fully understood, appreciated \\nand used in multifarious situations and settings. Hence, the diversity and inclusion \\nmovement is another worldwide factor increasing the demand for Empathy and the \\nteam H-PC.\\nEmpathy and the team H-PC are important from further standpoint. Humanity \\ntoday is faced with a variety of global, multifaceted and interconnected issues that \\ninclude climate change, income inequalities within and between nations, pandemics, \\npollution, and war. These issues can only be resolved through long-term interna-\\ntional co-operation which requires leaders to use high levels of Empathy, Conceptual \\nFlexibility, Managing Interaction and Developmental Orientation.\\nWith these four rising demands for the team H-PC cluster in mind, it is helpful to \\nconsider the H-PC strengths and limitations of contemporary leaders. Data gathered \\nfrom a state-of-the-art leadership assessment centre (LAC) over a 20-year period \\nprovides an insight into this issue. Table 4 presents the summary H-PC profile of \\n1632 LAC participants who worked in a diverse range of public and private sec -\\ntor organisations in the US, Europe and Asia. The data show that Empathy (2.73), \\nDevelopmental Orientation (2.68), Managing Interaction (2.65) and Conceptual \\nFlexibility (2.53) all had mean ratings below 3.00 (the ‘ Adequacy’ level) and were \\nall rated significantly lower than the three strongest H-PC, which had ratings well \\nabove 3.00.\\nThis data provides much food for thought. If representative, it suggests the \\nH-PC that are probably the most needed in modernity are the least developed. Even'),\n",

Capability rather \\nthan motivation may be the fundamental constraint, which implies there should be a \\nfundamental reorientation of leadership development towards Empathy and the other \\nunderdeveloped H-PC.\\nIn summary, the need for Empathy both today and in the future appears to be \\nhigh. Y et LAC data indicate Empathy is underdeveloped, which probably means it \\nis undervalued. Much greater investment in the development of Empathy amongst \\ncurrent and future leaders appears necessary. A policy change that applies equally \\nto the other highly demanded yet underdeveloped team H-PC. Without such a shift \\nin leadership development, leaders will remain ill-prepared for the major worldwide \\nchallenges they face.\\n7. Conclusions\\nEmpathy has consistently been identified as an important leadership behaviour \\nsince systematic empirical studies began in the 1940’ s. Two meta-analyses show that \\nleaders who use Empathy are more effective. The H-PC research stream has contrib-\\nuted a definition of Empathy, a five-point behaviourally anchored rating scale, and a \\nreliable assessor training methodology. State-of-the-art ratings of observed leadership \\nbehaviour by certified H-PC assessors show significant positive correlations between \\nEmpathy and criterion measures. All these efforts support a strong ongoing focus on \\nEmpathy in leadership research and development.\\nEmpathy is one of several H-PC that help build and maintain lateral integration in \\norganically designed organisational structures; these flatter and more participative \\nstructures are made essential by increasing environmental innovation, dynamism and \\ncomplexity and they find most support in democratic regimes.\\nWhen used in combination with the other Developmental H-PC (Managing \\nInteraction and Developmental Orientation), Empathy operationalizes a democratic \\nleadership style that contrasts with the more autocratically oriented Directional H-PC \\nfactor. The Developmental and Directional clusters are the two fundamental ways \\nthat leaders interpersonally interact with others. The former are is demanded most by \\norganic structures and situations requiring creativity, imagination and innovation; \\nthe latter by mechanistic structures and crises/emergencies.\\nLeaders can gain much by using Empathy in conjunction with H-PC from the \\nother factors. When combined with Conceptual Flexibility, Empathy enables leaders \\nto grasp the complexity of multifaceted situations and take holistic decisions. When \\ncombined with Impact, Empathy permits leaders to build win-win alliances and to \\nsocialize the Directional H-PC factor, so it has greater relevance to modernity.\\nEmpathy is vital to high performing teams, which have never been in greater \\ndemand. In the H-PTD methodology, Empathy is the core Stage 2 behaviour; it \\nenables participants to share and understand multiple perspectives, which provides \\nan essential stepping-stone towards superior team effectiveness.\\nThe rise of organic organisational designs, the growing importance of democratic \\ninstitutions to global economic growth, the diversity and inclusion movement and the \\nmajor challenges facing humanity all indicate that the team H-PC cluster in general, \\nand Empathy in particular, should receive greater developmental investment—espe-\\ncially as those H-PC seem undervalued and underdeveloped at present.

Introduction\\nThe empathetic abilities of healthcare professionals are central to achieving the\\nbest patient outcomes in all fields of medicine, in physiotherapy, and midwifery.\\nNext to being closely linked to treatment success and outcomes, the quality of\\nprovider interaction strongly affects howpatients experience their treatment and\\ntheir overall hospital stay. Patients highlight that empathetic communication is\\nessential to their experience of respectful care, but they frequently experience\\ndissatisfying or even disrespectful communication with their healthcare/home-care\\nproviders [1, 2]. Empathetic communication between health care provider and\\npatient is key to facilitating shared decision making and negotiation around medical\\noptions and alternatives [3], which is an important factor for reducing healthcare\\ncosts as shared decision making can reduce unnecessary procedures or re-admission\\nto hospital [4].\\nWhilst the relationship between healthcare providers and patients ideally is char-\\nacterized by a partnership that facilitates patients’ informed decision making and also\\nby reciprocity in the interactions. It is important to emphasize that ultimately it is the\\nhealthcare providers who are responsible and accountable for the quality of their\\ncommunication with their patients.\\nResearch suggests that student empathy can decline during their educational years\\n[5, 6]. Scarcity of practice placements is a challenge in many healthcare educational\\nsettings and may leave students with limited experience with communicating with\\npatients in a particular setting, contributing to difficulty in empathizing with their\\npatients. Targeted activities have been found to enhance and sustain healthcare stu-\\ndents’ empathy [7]. It is thus of high importance to offer training and practice to\\nhealthcare students that assists them in identifying opportunities to express and\\ncommunicate empathy when providing care.\\n2. The aim of the empathy in health project\\nEmpathy in health is an Erasmus + funded project which aims to design a curricu-\\nlum for empathetic skills development in healthcare practitioners and home-carers\\nbased on up-to-date evidence and cutting-edge technology tools. To carry out the\\nproject, a consortium was established that included the following partners: Mediter-\\nranean Management Learning (MMC), University of Nicosia Medical School, Charite\\nUniversity Medicine Berlin (previously Protestant University of Applied Science Ber-\\nlin), University of Thessaly Physiotherapy Department, Department of Health Sci-\\nences Research Group Organization, Policy and Social Inequalities in Healthcare\\n(OPIH), Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Omega Technology, and Cyprus Certification\\nCompany.\\nThe objective of this research project has been to develop a certified three-day\\ncurriculum that will use a skills-based approach, educational videos, role-plays, and\\nvirtual reality scenarios to teach and empower healthcare students and home-carers to\\ndevelop their empathetic skills during their encounters with patients and their carers\\nand also their colleagues while avoiding burnout.\\nThe aim of this curriculum is, therefore, to inform and train undergraduate and\\ngraduate healthcare students who will be future healthcare professionals with the\\nnecessary knowledge, skills, and competencies in developing and maintaining empa-\\nthetic interactions.

Development of the empathy in health curriculum\\n4.1 A curriculum at EQF Level 7\\nThis curriculum is based on the European Qualification Framework (EQF). The\\nEQF is an 8-level framework based on learning outcomes. It is designed for all types of\\nqualifications and serves as a translation tool between different national qualification\\nframeworks. The main purpose of the EQF is to make qualifications more readable\\nand understandable across countries and systems. This is important to support cross-\\nborder mobility of learners and workers and lifelong learning across Europe (see\\nDescription of the eight EQF levels).\\nMore specifically, the curriculum is designed for Level 7 of the EQF. This means\\nthat the learning outcomes focus on students in the second cycle of higher education.\\nThis cycle typically finishes with a qualification labeled“Master” and is obtained after\\nthe successful completion of a study program with 60–120 ECTS credits. https://www.\\nehea.info/page-three-cycle-system.\\nTable 4provides information regarding the curriculum at a glance.\\n4.2 The aim of the training program\\nEmpathy is the key to effective communication between patients and health carers\\n[9] and has been shown to positively affect health outcomes and patient satisfaction\\nbut also improve patient safety [10]. Communicating with patients is the most fre-\\nquently used procedure by healthcare providers, however, communication skills\\ntraining in undergraduate healthcare programs is variable and assessment of interper-\\nsonal competencies often neither reliable nor consistent [11].\\nThe training program“Empathy in Health” aims to fill this gap in healthcare\\neducation. The focus of the program is to enable students to communicate empathet-\\nically with patients, families, and colleagues in different situations and to identify\\nchallenges and barriers to their empathetic capacities, including burnout and stress.\\nThe program is aiming to enable students to:\\nThemes Categories\\nWork Area 1: General overview of empathy 1.1: Understanding empathy and competencies\\nnecessary for empathy.\\nWork Area 2: Empathy in relationships and\\ninformation exchanges in different healthcare\\ncontexts/environments.\\n2.1: Understanding empathy in relationships and\\ninformation exchanges in different healthcare\\ncontexts/environments.\\nWork Area 3: Showing empathy in diverse\\nenvironments and overcoming barriers/challenges to\\nempathy.\\n3.1: Showing empathy in diverse environments.\\n3.2: Challenges to empathy in healthcare and how\\nto overcome these.\\nTable 3.\\nThemes that emerged from focus groups.\\n148\\nEmpathy - Advanced Research and Applications'),\n",

The\\ncurriculum focuses on the skills necessary to develop a relationship that fosters and\\nnurtures empathy and trust and to enhance patient-centred information exchanges.\\nA subsequent part of the current curriculum deals with the importance of cultural\\ncompetence in patients and working with colleagues from various cultural and social\\nbackgrounds. Cultural competence is a critical core component of health professionals\\nand should be considered as a part of“best practice” in providing empathetic patient-\\ncare. Achieving cultural competence is a process that is cultivated within the individ-\\nual through the acquisition of knowledge, attitudes, skills and behaviors specific to\\nculture, language, and communication.\\nThe last part of the curriculum focuses on enabling students to understand the\\ncomplex relationship between empathy and burnout in healthcare. In response to high\\nlevels of burnout in the healthcare professions which can affect professionals’ empa-\\nthetic abilities, as well as affect their mental and emotional health and retention, the\\ncurriculum aims to enable students to apply methods that prevent or alleviate symp-\\ntoms of burnout.\\n4.5 Training methodology\\nThe course is taught in a modular structure using work areas that have been\\nderived from initial research conducted in the project.\\nEach working area focuses onone important aspect of empathy in health care.\\nStarting with a general introduction to empathy the students then deepen their com-\\npetencies by focussing on empathetic communication and dealing with intercultural\\nsituations and threats to empathetic behavior.\\nWith an emphasis on practical exercises that are facilitated using virtual reality\\ntechniques or role-plays, the participants experience their competence in empathy\\ndirectly and receive feedback from their peers– this enables them to work on\\nimproving their empathetic abilities individually or in groups.\\nKnowledge is transmitted in classroom teaching via lecture and by instructing\\nstudents to perform interactive exercises in pairs or triads to foster learning and\\npractice the aimed skills. The classroom structure has been chosen because of the\\nsocial aspect of empathy and the importance of nonverbal and verbal communication\\nwhich is difficult to realize in a digital environment.\\nCongruent with the concept of a flipped classroom where theoretical aspects are\\nfirst taught via asynchronous electronic learning and then discussed and practiced in\\nthe classroom. Asynchronous electronic learning in this course is used to underline the\\nimportance of empathy and motivate the students before the course starts. It is also\\nused to assess the competencies acquired during the course by assessing exchange\\nbetween peers, self-reflection, and a knowledge quiz.\\n150\\nEmpathy - Advanced Research and Applications'),\n",

It can also be integrated as a training course in the context of\\nlifelong learning activities.\\n4.6 Classroom teaching\\nIn this course, classroom teaching has been chosen to enable students to practice\\ntheir empathetic and communicative competencies with peers and the teacher via\\nrole-plays and virtual reality exercises right after a theoretical input. The classroom\\nteaching focuses on the theory-practice transfer right away.\\nTheoretical content is presented using PowerPoint presentations. Following this\\nusing self-reflection exercises, group work, and experiential exercises (role-play and\\nVR) the tutor assures that students are able to translate theory and knowledge into\\nskills that are directly transferable to their professions. In other words, the students\\nachieve the desired learning outcome, which is to act empathetically in their profession.\\n4.7 Asynchronous electronic learning\\nAsynchronous electronic learning describes the possibility of initiating targeted\\nlearning processes in virtual learning spaces by means of digital media, alone or in\\ngroups, synchronously or asynchronously. Access takes place online and is linked to\\nthe possibility of communicating with teachers and other learners [12].\\nIn this course, an online learning platform provides learning content, precise\\nexercises to prepare for classroom teaching, and the possibility to communicate with\\npeers and teachers.\\n4.8 Directed self-learning\\nIn directed self-learning students direct their own learning process to achieve the\\ncompetencies of their learning project. However, it does not mean they need to realize\\nit alone, directed self-learning can also include consultation of peers and the creation\\nof learning networks, for example, a community of practice.

The extent of the burden of mental disorders on family members\\nis difﬁcult to assess and quantify, and is consequently often ignored. \\nHowever, it does have a signiﬁcant impact on the family’s quality of life. \\n• In addition to the health and social costs, those suffering from mental \\nillnesses are also victims of human rights violations, stigma and discrimi-\\nnation, both inside and outside psychiatric institutions.'),\n",

The cost of mental health problems in developed countries is estimated to be between 3% and\\n4% of GNP . However, mental disorders cost national economies several billion dollars, both in terms of expenditures\\nincurred and loss of productivity. The average annual costs, including medical, pharmaceutical and disability costs, for\\nemployees with depression may be 4.2 times higher than those incurred by a typical beneﬁciary. However, the cost of\\ntreatment is often completely offset by a reduction in the number of days of absenteeism and productivity lost while \\nat work.\\nAlleviating the problem: prevention, promotion and management programmes\\nA combination of well-targeted treatment and prevention programmes in the ﬁeld of mental health, within overall pub-\\nlic strategies, could avoid years lived with disability and deaths, reduce the stigma attached to mental disorders, increase\\nconsiderably the social capital, help reduce poverty and promote a country’s development. \\nStudies provide examples of effective programmes targeted at different age groups – from prenatal and early infancy\\nprogrammes, through adolescence to old age – and different situations, such as post-traumatic stress following acci-\\ndents, marital stress, work-related stress, and depression or anxiety due to job loss, widowhood or adjustment to retire-\\nment. Many more studies need to be conducted in this area, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. There is\\nstrong evidence to show that successful interventions for schizophrenia, depression and other mental disorders are not\\nonly available, but are also affordable and cost-effective.\\nYet there is an enormous gap between the need for treatment of mental disorders and the resources available. In devel-\\noped countries with well organized health care systems, between 44% and 70% of patients with mental disorders do\\nnot receive treatment.

Unfortunately, the lack of\\nunderstanding on the part of most\\nemployers, and the lack of special\\nemployment schemes to address this\\nissue, sometimes render it difﬁcult for\\nfamily members to gain employment\\nor to hold on to an existing job, or\\nthey may suffer a loss of earnings due\\nto days taken off from work. This\\ncompounds the ﬁnancial costs associ-\\nated with treating and caring for\\nsomeone with a mental disorder. \\nFamily burden cannot be ignored\\nMental disorders: a significant burden on the family.\\nThe burden of mental disorders goes beyond that which has been defined\\nby Disability Adjusted Life Years. \\nThe extent of the burden of mental disorders on family members is difficult\\nto assess and quantify, and is consequently often ignored. However, it does\\nhave a significant impact on the family’s quality of life.\\nTalking about mental disorders means \\ntalking about stigma and human rights\\ning conditions. For example, there\\nhave been documented cases of peo-\\nple being tied to logs far away from\\ntheir communities for extensive peri-\\nods of time and with inadequate food,\\nshelter or clothing. Furthermore, often\\npeople are admitted to and treated in\\nmental health facilities against their\\nwill. Issues concerning consent for\\nadmission and treatment are often\\nignored, and independent assessments\\nof capacity are not undertaken. This\\nPersons with mental disorders often\\nsuffer a wide range of human rights\\nviolations and social stigma.\\nIn many countries, people with mental\\ndisorders have limited access to the\\nmental health treatment and care they\\nrequire, due to the lack of mental\\nhealth services in the area in which\\nthey live or in the country as a whole.\\nFor example, the WHO Atlas Survey\\nshowed that 65% of psychiatric beds\\nare in mental hospitals, where condi-\\ntions are extremely unsatisfactory.\\nInpatient places should be moved\\nfrom mental hospitals to general \\nhospitals and community rehabilita-\\ntion services.\\nViolations in psychiatric\\ninstitutions are rife\\nMany psychiatric institutions have\\ninadequate, degrading and even\\nharmful care and treatment practices,\\nas well as unhygienic and inhuman liv-'),\n",

The use of restraints such as caged beds restricts the mobility of\\npatients, which can result in a number of physical hazards such as pressure sores, not to mention the harmful psycho-\\nlogical effects.

In 41% of countries\\nthere are no mental health training\\nprogrammes for primary health care\\nprofessionals.\\nLack of rational and\\ncomprehensive mental health\\npolicies and legislation \\n• 40% of countries do not have \\na mental health policy;\\n• 25% of countries do not have \\nmental health legislation; and \\n• 30% of countries do not have a\\nnational mental health programme.'),\n",

The scarcity of resource forces their rational use.\\nThe World Health Report 2001 and the Atlas: Mental Health Resources in the World, have revealed an unsatisfactory\\nsituation with regard to mental health care in many countries, particularly in developing countries. WHO is engaged in\\nproviding technical assistance to Ministries of Health in developing mental health policy and services. Building national\\ncapacity is a priority to enhance the mental health of populations. \\nWHO has designed a mental health policy and service guidelines to address the wide variety of needs and priorities in\\npolicy development and service planning, and a manual on how to reform and implement mental health law.\\nTo put plans into action, WHO is adapting the level and types of implementation to the general level of resources of\\nindividual countries. In the particular case of developing countries, where the gap between mental health needs and the\\nresources to meet them is greater, WHO will offer differentiated packages of “achievable targets” for implementation\\n(Gap Reduction Achievable National Targets/GRANTs)to countries grouped by at least three levels of resources (low,\\nmiddle and relatively higher). These packages provide the minimum required set of feasible actions to be undertaken to\\ncomply with the 10 recommendations spelt out in the World Health Report 2001. Achievement of the identiﬁed targets\\nwill inﬂuence both health and social outcomes, namely mortality due to suicide or to alcohol/illicit drugs, morbidity and\\ndisability due to the key mental disorders, quality of life, and, ﬁnally, human rights. \\nStrategy 4\\nBuilding local capacity for public mental health research in poor countries.\\nBesides advocacy, policy assistance and knowledge transfer, mhGAP formulates in some detail the active role that infor-\\nmation and research ought to play in the multidimensional efforts required to change the current mental health gap at\\ncountry level. \\nWHO is developing several projects and activities to promote this strategy at country level, including a research fellow-\\nship programme targeting developing countries. A project on the cost-effectiveness of mental health strategies is being\\nimplemented in selected countries to generate real estimates on the costs and beneﬁts of mental health interventions.\\nThese estimates will then be used to enhance mental health services at country level.\\nAt the Executive Board meeting in January 2002 a resolution on\\nmental health encouraging continued activity in this area was\\nadopted. The resolution strongly supports the direction of mhGAP\\nand urges action by Member States. The resolution was endorsed\\nunanimously by the World Health Assembly in May 2002.'),\n",

In all phases of a\\nrecent small-scale research project, conceptual confusion was identiﬁed in the literature review\\nand among participants (Leighton 2008). Ironically, referring to mental illness in terms of\\nmental health originated in the 1960s in an attempt to reduce stigma (Rowling et al. 2002).\\nThere is no widely agreed consensus on the meaning of these terms and their use. Mental health\\nand mental illness can be perceived as two separate, yet related, issues.\\nRyff and Singer (1998) suggest that health is not a medical concept associated with absence\\nof illness, but rather a philosophical one that requires an explanation of a good life – being one\\nwhere an individual has a sense of purpose, is engaged in quality relationships with others, and\\npossesses self-respect and mastery. This is synonymous with the World Health Organization\\n(WHO) (2000, 2005b) deﬁnition of positive mental health.\\nHowever, such a de ﬁnition is incomplete as individuals do not exist in isolation, but are\\ninﬂuenced by, and inﬂuence, their social and physical environments. Furthermore, people will\\nhave their own individual interpretations of what a good life is. Rowling et al.

Furthermore, all\\nhealth issues need to be considered within a cultural and developmental context, as do the\\nsocial constructs of childhood and adolescence (Walker 2005). The quality of a person’s mental\\nhealth is in ﬂuenced by idiosyncratic factors and experiences, their family relationships and\\ncircumstances and the wider community in which they live (WHO 2004). Additionally, each\\nculture in ﬂuences people ’s understanding of, and attitudes towards, mental health issues.\\nHowever, a culture-speciﬁc approach to understanding and improving mental health can be\\nunhelpful if it assumes homogeneity within cultures and ignores individual differences (WHO\\n2004). Culture is only one, albeit important, factor that in ﬂuences individuals ’ beliefs and\\nactions (Tomlinson 2001; Dogra 2003). Interaction between different factors may lead to differ-\\nent outcomes for different individuals.\\nIt can be argued that the above approaches are rooted in western perspectives. However, they\\nprovide a useful starting point from which to discuss mental health issues with children and\\ntheir families.\\nDeﬁnitions of child mental health\\nDeﬁnitions of mental health as they relate speci ﬁcally to children have been provided by the\\nHealth Advisory Service (HAS) (1995) and the Mental Health Foundation (1999). These def-\\ninitions bear similarities to those provided by Ryff and Singer (1998) and Rowling et al. (2002),\\nwhile recognizing the developmental context of childhood – i.e. the ability to develop psycho-\\nlogically, emotionally, creatively, intellectually and spiritually; initiate, develop and sustain\\nmutually satisfying personal relationships; use and enjoy solitude; become aware of others and\\nempathize with them; play and learn; develop a sense of right and wrong; and resolve problems\\nand setbacks and learn from them (HAS 1995; Mental Health Foundation 1999). Such deﬁnitions\\nare useful as they relate to ‘societal’ expectations of children.\\nDifferent deﬁnitions are used to de ﬁne mental ill health. The WHO uses the term ‘mental\\ndisorders’ broadly, to include mental illness, intellectual disability, personality disorder, sub-\\nstance dependence and adjustment to adverse life events (WHO 1992). The WHO acknowledges\\nthat the word ‘disorder’ is used to avoid perceived greater difﬁculties associated with ‘illness’ –\\nfor example, stigma and the emphasis on a medical model. Meltzer et al. (2000) use the term\\n‘mental disorders’ in reference to emotional, conduct, hyperkinetic and less common disorders\\nas deﬁned by the ICD (International Classi ﬁcation of Diseases) 10 and DSM ( Diagnostic and\\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders ) IV. Jorm (2000) focuses speci ﬁcally on depression and\\npsychosis. Meanwhile, Rowling et al. (2002) use the terms ‘mental illness’ and ‘mental disorder’\\ninterchangeably. Johns (2002) and the British Medical Association (BMA 2006) identify that\\nthe term ‘mental health problems ’ is used to cover a broad spectrum of conditions ranging\\nfrom diagnosable disorders such as anxiety and depression, through to acting out behaviours.\\nThe BMA (2006) also distinguish between mental disorders and illness, with illness being severe\\npsychiatric disorders such as depression and psychosis.\\nDeﬁning mental health and mental illness 9'),\n",

Rickwood et al. (2005) refer to ‘young people’s help-seeking for\\nmental health problems’ and proceed to use various terms including ‘psychological distress’,\\n‘mental health issues’, ‘mental health problems’ and ‘mental disorder’. The interchangeable use\\nof these terms in effect renders them meaningless, as their use may reﬂect an individual’s bias,\\nor political correctness, rather than indicating the extent or severity of the problem. However,\\nall identify alterations in mood, thinking and behaviour associated with distress or impaired\\nfunctioning across various domains.\\nEntity or dimension?\\nKendall (1988) presents the relative merits of using categories and dimensions with respect\\nto mental disorders. Typically, medicine has used categories, given its roots in the biological\\nsciences. Categorization allows for easier de ﬁnitions, recognition if someone ﬁts a particular\\ncategory and therefore conformity with a clinical concept. However, a dimensions approach\\nallows for greater ﬂexibility. Kendall (1988) concludes that where psychotic illness is concerned\\na categorical approach may be preferable, whereas in other conditions the situation is more\\nlikely to be changeable, and would perhaps beneﬁt from a dimensional perspective.\\nOne way of distinguishing between distress associated with adverse life events and more\\nsevere disorders which involve physiological symptoms and underlying biological changes is to\\ndistinguish between mental health problems and mental illness, using a multi-dimensional\\nmodel. This has an additional advantage in enabling normal ‘distress’ (e.g. grief following\\nbereavement) to be recognized as part of the ‘human condition’, rather than being medicalized\\nand possibly classed as ‘depression’. It is suggested that a variety of normal human experiences\\nhave become medicalized through an ever increasing range of psychological disorders with\\nvirtually every type of behaviour eligible for a medical label (e.g. social phobia, over-eating\\ndisorder, dependent personality disorder) (Illich 1977; WHO 1992; American Psychiatric\\nAssociation 1994).\\nRowling et al. (2002) propose that mental health and mental illness can be seen to exist as\\npart of a multi-dimensional model. An exemplar of mental health and mental illness being\\ntwo separate and yet related continua can be found in the vulnerability-stress working model\\ndeveloped by Asarnow et al. (2001). This model suggests how the effects of ongoing stress on\\nmental health can lead to mental illness (depression) if left unchallenged.\\nDepression is classed as a diagnosable disorder which is reported to be on the increase (WHO\\n1996). However, the term ‘depression’ is also employed in everyday language for a variety of\\nstates of distress: demoralization as a result of long-term suffering; living with chronic adversity\\nand stress; reaction to loss; low self-esteem; and pessimistic outlook. While there are similarities\\nbetween the feelings of unhappiness, despondency, frustration and sense of hopelessness\\nassociated with a state of emotional stress and with depression, the latter involves pervasive\\nphysical symptoms such as sleep and appetite disturbance, and, ultimately, changes in brain\\nchemistry. However, the cut-off between what is ‘normal’ stress and what is depression may\\nnot always be clear. It is not just the presence of symptoms that de ﬁnes a disorder but also its\\nseverity and pervasiveness as well as its impact on everyday functioning.\\nThus, from a dimensional perspective, many features of mental disorder (psychosis excepted)\\ncan be viewed as part of the range of ‘normal’ human behaviour. For example, anxiety is\\na normal human response to the perception of danger. Different types of anxiety are develop-\\nmentally appropriate during childhood – for example, separation is an issue for infants,\\nacademic performance can cause anxiety during middle childhood and peer rejection concerns\\nadolescents (Moore and Carr 2000).\\n10 Nursing in child and adolescent mental health'),\n",

In all phases of a recent\\nresearch project, conceptual confusion was identiﬁed in the literature review and among ado-\\nlescent participants (Leighton 2006, 2008). Focus group participants did not ﬁnd the single\\ncontinuum model suggested by the WHO (2000) helpful (Leighton 2006). Furthermore, in the\\nfocus group feedback session, participants suggested that labelling serious mental illnesses such\\nas schizophrenia and major depression, as ‘mental health problems’, diminishes the seriousness\\nof mental illness, with implications for attitudes towards, and treatment of, those with mental\\nillness (Leighton 2006). It is also evident that there is considerable confusion for young people\\nbetween the terms ‘mental health’, ‘mental illness’ and ‘learning disability’ (Dogra et al. 2007;\\nRose et al. 2007).\\nHowever, whatever terminology is used, the scale of individual suffering from mental health\\nproblems and illness is signiﬁcant, and this is now brieﬂy outlined.\\nThe scale of the problem\\nThe number of people experiencing mental health problems worldwide is reported to have risen\\nto nearly epidemic proportions, with depression identi ﬁed as the leading cause of disability\\namong 15 –44-year-olds (WHO 1996). In the UK the prevalence of mental health problems\\namong adolescents is high. One in 20 is reported to be experiencing mental health problems at\\nany given time (Mental Health Foundation 1999; Meltzer et al. 2000; Coleman and Scho ﬁeld\\n2005). The Ofﬁce for National Statistics (ONS) survey carried out in 1999 identiﬁed the follow-\\ning prevalence rates of diagnosable mental disorder among 11–15-year-olds: depression 1.8 per\\ncent; anxiety 4.6 per cent; conduct disorder 6.2 per cent (Meltzer et al. 2000). Moreover, the\\nprevalence of serious mental illness increases greatly during adolescence (Davidson and Manion\\n1996; Smith and Leon 2001; Rickwood et al. 2005). Such problems have a negative impact on an\\nindividual’s development across all areas of their lives – i.e. self-esteem, relationships, academic\\nsuccess, career options and lifestyle (Mental Health Foundation 1999; Meltzer et al.  2000).\\nFurthermore, the burden of adolescent mental health problems and illness involves enormous\\nﬁnancial costs to individuals, families and society. These include loss of earnings for parents\\nand adolescents, and social care, health service, education and Home Of ﬁce costs (Appleton\\nand Hammond-Rowley 2000). Although the scale of the problem is vast, studies indicate that\\nless than a ﬁfth of young people who need mental health care actually receive any services and,\\nof those who do receive services, less than half obtain services appropriate to their need (Atkins\\net al. 2003; Hinshaw 2005).\\nStigma and mental illness\\nIn this section the aim is to explore the concepts of, and the relationship between, stigma and\\nmental illness. One possible reason for both conceptual confusion and reluctance to seek help is\\nthat the stigmatization of mental illness continues to be a worldwide phenomenon (Jorm et al.\\n1997; Crisp et al. 2000; Sartorius 2002; Gureje et al. 2005).\\nDeﬁnition of the concept of stigma\\nStigma can be viewed as a social construct.

The concept is applied in\\ndiverse circumstances, including with reference to the mentally ill (Link and Phelan 2001).\\nAdditionally, stigmatization can be seen to depend on social, economic and political power and\\ncan occur on a large and tragic scale – for example, the systematic and dreadful stigmatization\\nof the Jewish people by the Nazis (Link and Phelan 2001). Stigma was de ﬁned by Goffman\\n(1970) as the position of the individual who is disquali ﬁed from full social acceptance. It is\\nperceived as the outcome of a process of social labelling which singles out difference, names this\\ndifference inferiority, subsequently blames those who are different for their otherness and\\ncontributes to the creation of a spoilt identity (Goffman 1970). Since that seminal develop-\\nment, the concept has evolved. For example, stigma can be described with reference to the\\nrelationships between a set of interrelated concepts, rather than focusing solely on personal\\nattributes – i.e. stigma exists when elements of labelling, stereotyping, separation, status loss\\nand discrimination occur together in a power situation that allows these processes to happen\\n(Link and Phelan 2001).\\nThe nature and extent of stigmatization in adult mental illness\\nThere are many factors involved in the formation of individuals ’ beliefs about mental illness,\\nand their attitudes and behaviour towards those labelled as mentally ill. These include personal\\nexperience of mental illness, either personally or in someone known to them; the impact of the\\nmedia; beliefs as to what causes mental illness (e.g. genetic, self-in ﬂicted); and socio-cultural\\ninﬂuences (Hinshaw 2005).\\nFour possible explanations for the stigmatization of mental illness have been identi ﬁed in\\nthe research literature:\\n\\x7f dangerousness;\\n\\x7f attribution of responsibility;\\n\\x7f belief that mental illness is chronic with a poor prognosis;\\n\\x7f disruption of normal social interactions based on social rules (Hayward and Bright 1997).\\nThese explanations can be elaborated as follows: people with mental illness are perceived as\\ndangerous and unpredictable; there is an implied belief that the mentally ill choose to behave\\nas they do and have only themselves to blame for their situation; people with mental illness\\nare believed to respond poorly to treatment, and outcomes are poor, therefore they are an\\nembarrassment and should be avoided; the mentally ill are seen as dif ﬁcult to communicate\\nwith and this makes for unpredictable social intercourse. These are enduring themes, provoking\\npersonal fear in others and threatening to upset the status quo (Hayward and Bright 1997;\\nEminson 2004).\\nExplanations for the stigmatization of the mentally ill include the following ideas.\\n\\x7f From a biological perspective, a person suffering from mental illness may be viewed as a poor\\ngenetic choice in relation to reproductive potential and as a possible threat to the safety of\\nthe individual.\\n\\x7f The need to share understanding in order to survive as an individual and as a species means\\nthat when a person’s way of perceiving the world is unfamiliar to us we can feel threatened\\nand uncertain as to how to respond to them (Eminson 2004).\\nMedia, mental illness and stigma\\nThere is a dearth of research which focuses speciﬁcally on how mental illness is depicted in the\\nchildren’s and young persons’ media (Wahl 2002).

Work by Wahl (2003) suggests that this is equally\\napplicable to children.\\nConsequences of stigma\\nStigmatization of the mentally ill is understood to be prejudicial to them, injurious to all aspects\\nof their treatment in mental health services and damaging to their role as members of society\\n(Hinshaw 2005). Stigmatization leads to individual and social discrimination against the stig-\\nmatized person. Several authors identify that the discriminatory behaviour displayed can be\\nhostile or avoidant and that it operates throughout personal and social relationships, pervading\\nthe home, workplace, local community, health and social welfare systems. This can result in\\nincreased feelings of shame, increased personal and social impairment and isolation, perpetu-\\nation and worsening of an illness, reluctance to access health care and infringement of human\\nrights (Link and Phelan 2001; Crisp 2004; Hinshaw 2005).\\nChildren, mental illness and stigma\\nThere is also a scarcity of research examining the issue of stigma in relation to children and\\nmental illness (Wahl 2002; Hinshaw 2005). As described previously, the high prevalence of\\nmental health problems in young people and their reluctance to access specialist services gives\\ncause for concern. The indications are that children develop negative attitudes towards those\\nwith mental illness early on (Gale 2007). Additionally, adolescents are the adults of the future\\nand therefore their beliefs and attitudes regarding mental health and illness will affect service\\ndevelopment, the quality of life of those experiencing mental health problems and the help-\\nseeking behaviour of individuals (Armstrong et al. 2000; Hinshaw 2005).\\nBox 1.2 highlights themes identiﬁed from work which focused on adolescents, mental illness\\nand stigma, albeit to varying degrees and using different methods.\\nBox 1.2 Themes associated with mental illness and stigma identiﬁed\\nby adolescents\\n• Negative attitudes towards groups described as deviant – for example, the mentally\\nill – were apparent by kindergarten and increased with age (Weiss 1986, 1994;\\nWahl 2002).\\nDeﬁning mental health and mental illness 13'),\n",

The need for education among the public,\\nand adolescents in particular, in order to combat the stigma of mental illness is highlighted\\nin the literature (Davidson and Manion 1996; Armstrong et al.  1998; Esters et al.  1998;\\nBailey 1999; Secker et al.  1999; Taylor 2001; Naylor et al.  2002; Pow 2003; Hinshaw 2005;\\nSessa 2005b).\\nEarly indicators from our own work in Nigeria are that such attitudes transcend culture\\n(Dogra 2009). However, there is evidence that stigma can be tackled. We will now examine\\nsome of the interventions undertaken to reduce stigma among children.\\nInterventions to reduce stigma\\nLarge-scale interventions, such as high proﬁle campaigns, are often difﬁcult to evaluate. In the\\nUK there have been several such campaigns – for example, The Royal College of Psychiatrists ’\\ncampaign, ‘Every Family in the Land ’ (Crisp 2004) and the WHO ‘Dare to Care ’ campaign\\n(WHO 2001). There is little evidence available to indicate that these have successfully changed\\npublic or personal attitudes, although there is evidence that more targeted initiatives may reap\\nbeneﬁts (WHO 2005a). While much of the work to date has focused on adults, there are increas-\\ning efforts to address the issue among younger populations.\\nThere is scope for joint working between schools and child and adolescent mental health\\nservices (CAMHS) in order to provide mental health promotion and reduce stigma. However,\\nit is important that we do not attempt to reduce stigma by just changing the terminology used,\\nas there is no evidence that such strategies work.\\nOne small-scale local study found that young people thought they might be helped by\\n14 Nursing in child and adolescent mental health'),\n",

In another such study,\\nadolescents who lived with parental mental illness suggested that the best ways of providing\\nadolescents with information about mental health included real experience and focusing on\\nthe issue in schools – i.e. existing sources of (mis)information. It was thought that those speak-\\ning out should be adolescents who were conﬁdent to talk about their situation, but they should\\nnot talk to people they knew for fear of being bullied and they should be pupils at other schools\\n(Leighton 2006).\\nTwo school-based interventions reported promising results. Rahman et al. (1998) concluded\\nthat the school programme they undertook was successful in improving mental health aware-\\nness in the children and their community. Unfortunately, the intervention is only brie ﬂy\\ndescribed and it is dif ﬁcult to be clear whether attitudes towards mental health (and issues\\nabout stigma) were addressed, or whether awareness of mental health (and therefore knowledge\\nand understanding) informed the intervention. More recently, Pinfold et al. (2003) undertook\\nshort educational workshops with 472 secondary school children in the UK. Changes were\\nmost marked for female students and those who had personal contact with people with mental\\nhealth problems. Further analysis of the labels used to stigmatize people with mental illness\\nfound that of the 472 students sampled, 400 of them provided 250 words to describe a person\\nwith mental illness. Nearly half were derogatory (Rose et al. 2007). The authors conclude that\\nthere need to be interventions which address factual information about mental illness and\\nthat reduce the strong negative emotional reactions to people with mental illness. Effective\\nevaluation is unlikely to be possible if there is no clarity about the purpose of the intervention\\nor too many aspects covered in one evaluation (Naylor et al. 2002).\\nSummary\\nConsiderable terminological confusion exists in relation to issues associated with mental health\\ngenerally and among children and young people speci ﬁcally. Furthermore, stigmatizing atti-\\ntudes towards mental illness and related issues continue to pose a challenge. Children, young\\npeople and adults display similar negative attitudes towards both mental illness and individuals\\nexperiencing mental health problems or illness. However, there is some evidence that these\\nmight be amenable to interventions such as education.\\nYou may now wish to re ﬂect on the issues discussed in this chapter by returning to the\\nexercise in Box 1.1.\\nReferences\\nAmerican Psychiatric Association (1994) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , 4th edn.\\nArlington, VA: American Psychiatric Association.\\nAppleton, P.L. and Hammond-Rowley, S.

Their fundamental right to mental health & happiness can be \\ncompromised.  Providing mental health care training to health care \\nworkers  and raising awareness among individuals within resource-\\nlimited communities serves as a significant means not only to improv-\\ning access to care to individuals but also to preserving human rights.  \\nThis field guide aims to be a contribution to the broader effort to im-\\nprove the health, dignity, and quality of life for individuals in resource\\n-limited settings worldwide  with mental conditions. \\nPamela Smith, MD, completed specialty training in psychiatry at New \\nYork – Presbyterian University Hospital of Columbia & Cornell and \\nlater served on the faculty of the UCLA Medical School as an assis-\\ntant clinical professor in psychiatry.  She has worked in international \\nhumanitarian aid providing mental health support to people living \\nwith HIV/AIDS in Uganda, to survivors of the tsunami in Indonesia \\nand Sri Lanka, to survivors of the earthquake in Haiti, and to refugees \\nof the conflict in Darfur, Sudan.  Dr. Smith has participated in coordi-\\nnating projects with organizations and agencies including the AIDS \\nHealthcare Foundation (AHF), International Medical Corps (IMC), \\nWorld Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, and United Nations \\nHigh Commission for Refugees (UNHCR). In addition, she has \\nserved on the peer review panel of the United Nations/Inter-Agency \\nStanding Committee Mental Health Task Force developing interna-\\ntional guidelines for mental health interventions during emergency \\ndisaster relief.  Dr. Smith has also provided clinical services (general \\nadult outpatient psychiatry, telepsychiatry) to varied resource-limited \\ncommunities in urban and rural areas of the United States and has \\nworked for the U.S. Indian Health Services (IHS ) supporting the \\nmental health of Native Americans. \\nA special thanks to Aleksandra Bajic, PharmD for assistance with the \\nmedication guide and much gratitude is extended to Whitney A.

Neuropsychiatric disorders con-\\ntribute to approximately 13% of the global burden of disease and \\ncreate (to varying degrees among countries) burden in every coun-\\ntry in the world. \\nAssessments of mental health resources worldwide are done with \\nthe aim of shedding light on the most recent global view of re-\\nsources available to prevent neuropsychiatric disorders, provide \\nintervention, and protect human rights.  WHO reports of mental \\nhealth worldwide have examined resources with regard to geo-\\ngraphic region and economic status.  Categorizing countries into \\nregions is one way to organize the huge volume of information \\nabout mental health structures and services throughout the world.  \\nIn addition, looking at regions may be useful from an economic \\nperspective.  It has been established that many nations have no or \\nvery limited mental health programming and need to utilize the \\nsupport of other countries to develop a system of care.  Being in a \\nregion where a high percentage of neighboring countries have re-\\nsources can be useful for a country in the same area that has limita-\\ntions.  In addition, using the resources of a nation nearby may be \\nless expensive and a faster process than relying on resources from a \\nfar distance.'),\n",

In some \\ncases, the “regional” similarity appears to be related to historical, \\ncultural, or economic factors that may link and make a group of \\ncountries comparable for analysis.  \\nOther limitations include an inability to obtain information from \\nall countries on all variables, variations in how different countries \\ndefine mental health concepts, and variations from country to \\ncountry in sources of information.'),\n",

Trainers must decide on the desired goal of their train-\\ning sessions and then develop clear objectives that will lead to the \\ngoal. \\nGoals and objectives need to be relevant or directly applicable to \\nthe real situations staff face in their primary care settings. \\nExample\\n: A goal of a mental health training course for a group of \\nprimary care doctors may be that they learn to provide an effective \\ntreatment for an individual with a particular mental health condi-\\ntion.  Objectives toward this goal may include their a) learning to \\ntake a psychiatric history; b) learning the varied signs and symp-\\ntoms of varied mental health conditions; and c) learning the varied \\ntypes of therapies to manage conditions.  A number of objectives \\nmay be involved in achieving an overall goal.'),\n",

Help the \\nchild and family identify the actions that may represent the distress \\nand help them to identify the circumstances in which these actions \\noccur.  Even though a child’s emotions are developing he or she can \\nstill be taught basic ways to verbalize distress.  Using simple cultur-\\nally appropriate picture charts showing different emotions and situa-\\ntions with which the child can identify, can be a way to begin discus-\\nsions about feelings.  Encourage the verbalization of distress.   Ver-\\nbalization can improve another’s (family, schoolmates, teachers) abil-\\nity to understand the child’s problem and provide a more effective \\nresponse.  Help the child recognize and understand that negative feel-\\nings such as anger and disappointment are natural human emotions \\nand that there are constructive ways to manage these emotions (i.e. \\nhelp the child to identify and anticipate difficult situations and teach \\nthe child a variety of healthy responses to the situations).'),\n",

Enuresis may occur \\nduring sleep or while awake. Enuresis causes a lot of stress and \\nshame for the child and can lead to more serious problem if not \\ntreated early.  A thorough psychiatric history, mental status exami-\\nnation with emphasis on the developmental history, medical his-\\ntory, and social environment is important. \\n \\nManagement of Enuresis\\n \\nA medical evaluation should be done to eliminate underlying \\nmedical causes for the problem. Be sure to assess for environ-\\nmental conditions  (e.g. if the wetting occurs during school time, is \\nit due to dirty toilets, or unavailable toilets at school?).  Also assess \\nfor other underlying psychological distress (e.g. the child who wets \\nthe bed may experience nightmares or night terrors and may be too \\nafraid to go to the toilet).'),\n",

Because of the serious nature and impact of GBV, the \\nsubject is addressed exclusively in this chapter.   \\nThe data on the prevalence and incidence of GBV in insecure set-\\ntings have limitations due to under-reporting of incidents.  Under-\\nreporting occurs for many reasons including fear of retaliation and \\nre-victimization, stigma, self blame, and mistrust of authorities.  \\nData available on GBV have indicated, a female victim and male \\nperpetrator are involved most frequently. While men and boys may \\nalso be vulnerable to sexual violence (particularly in situations of \\ntorture and detention ) the majority of survivors/victims of sexual \\nviolence have been females.   \\nBecause there is a tendency for under-reporting, it is important that \\nhealthcare staff working in unstable environments have an aware-\\nness and willingness to take constructive action when violence is \\nsuspected.  This chapter provides an outline of information on the \\nnature, causes, effects, and active interventions associated with \\ngender-based violence in insecure settings.'),\n",

Specific types of GBV may vary across countries, re-\\ngions, and cultures and may include: a) domestic violence; b) \\nforced/early marriage; c) harmful traditional practices (e.g. female \\ngenital mutilation, honor killings, widow inheritance); d) traffick-\\ning; and e) sexual violence. \\n \\nRegarding sexual violence, it may be described as an unwanted, \\ndestructive sexual advance that is executed (e.g. as a sexual action) \\nor implied (e.g. as sexual verbal expression).  Studies have indi-\\ncated that power and control underlie the perpetration as opposed \\nto an amorous attraction or desire.  Forms of sexual violence seen \\nin insecure settings have included: rape (most often cited); at-\\ntempted assaults; verbal sexual threats and humiliating comments; \\nmolestation or repeated unwanted advances; domestic violence \\ntoward a spouse; and incest toward a  family relative. \\n \\nReports have indicated that groups associated with GBV perpetra-\\ntion in insecure settings may include fellow refugees; other clan \\nmembers; religious or ethnic groups; military personnel; relief \\nworkers; and family members.

STDs may increase a person’s risk for \\nbecoming infected with HIV by causing conditions that allow easier pas-\\nsage of the virus into the body (e.g. passage through open sores, ulcers, \\nand irritations).  The inflammatory process (resulting from damage by \\ncertain STDs to the skin surface) increases the presence and concentration \\nof immune cells to the area that can serve as targets for HIV (e.g. CD4+ \\ncells).  In addition, those infected with HIV, who contract subsequent \\nSTDs,  are at increased risk of transmitting the virus to sexual partners. \\nStudies indicate that those infected with HIV and also have other STDs \\ncan shed the virus in their genital secretions.  The higher the concentration \\nof HIV in genital fluids, the more likely the virus may be spread to a part-\\nner.   \\n      \\n \\nContracting an STD may have serious implications for one who is HIV-\\npositive. Some STDs are curable or eradicated with antibiotic treatment \\n(e.g. gonorrhea, syphilis).  However, others may not be eradicated fully \\nand may be associated with potentially fatal diseases such as cancer (HPV, \\nHep C) and liver failure (Hep B, Hep C).

Ob-\\nservation (e.g. viewing for tremors, drooling, stooped posture, and \\na shuffling walking pattern) and physical examination ( e.g. flexing \\nthe elbow joints and feeling the arm muscles for tightness or rigid-\\nity) are ways to detect symptoms.  Studies (western research) indi-\\ncate that EPS is more common with high potency typical antipsy-\\nchotics (e.g. haloperidol and fluphenazine) than with low potency \\nantipsychotics (e.g. phenothiazines such as chlorpromazine).  High \\ndoses of antipsychotic medication are associated with an increased \\nrisk for EPS.  Western studies (United States) have found that \\nsymptoms are more common in men under the age of 35 who have \\nmuscular body types.  EPS typically occur within the first 4 weeks \\nof antipsychotic use and are reversible\\n with  discontinuation of the \\ndrug.  Symptoms may disappear within days to months after antip-\\nsychotic medication has been stopped. If a patient needs to remain \\non medication to control severe psychotic symptoms, EPS may be \\nreduced with anticholinergic medicines such as trihexyphenidyl or \\ndiphenhydramine and, for akathisia specifically, propanolol and \\nbenzodiazepines (i.e. diazepam, lorazepam, and clonazepam).'),\n",

Nearly one \\nfifth of the global population is comprised of youth aged 14-24 years, with \\n85-90 per cent of this group living in low-income countries (Fisher and \\nCabral de Mello, 2011; Sawyer and others, 2012). In high-income countries, \\nit is estimated that about 5 per cent of the population have a serious mental \\nillness.  On a global level, it is estimated that approximately 20 per cent of \\nyouth experience a mental-health condition each year (Patel, Flisher, and \\nothers, 2007; United Nations Children’s Fund, 2012).  Y oung people are at \\ngreater risk of a range of mental-health conditions as they transition from \\nchildhood to adulthood (Kessler and others, 2005). \\nThere is considerable burden and disability associated with mental-\\nhealth conditions, particularly among those for whom the problems start \\nduring youth. Although much of the epidemiological research supporting \\nthese estimates comes from high-income countries, studies from low- and \\nmiddle- income countries provide similar prevalence estimates (Kieling and \\nothers, 2011).

Mental-health \\nconditions negatively impact youths’ development, quality of life and \\nability to fully participate in their communities (Fisher and Cabral de \\nMello, 2011).  Mental and behavioural conditions are the leading causes of \\nhealth problems in young people in both high- and low-resource countries, \\naccounting for one third of all years lost productivity due to disability \\n(World Health Organization, 2008b). \\nMental-health conditions have a significant impact on youth \\ndevelopment and social and economic integration. Mental-health \\nconditions during adolescence and young adulthood can have a significantly \\nnegative impact on the development of safe and healthy relationships with \\npeers, parents, teachers, and romantic partners. Many mental-health \\nconditions negatively affect youths’ ability to successfully form supportive \\nand healthy relationships and manage conflict in relationships, which is \\nparticularly disconcerting given that adolescence is a critical time for \\nidentity formation and taking on roles, especially with peers. Disruptions \\nin the ability to form and sustain interpersonal relationships can have \\nlasting impacts on youths’ social and emotional functioning. Mental-\\nhealth problems increase the likelihood of poverty, limit employment \\nopportunities severely, and impact work performance negatively (Kessler \\nand Frank, 1997).\\nTraumatic experiences, including adverse childhood events (e.g., the \\ndeath of a parent, abuse, being a refugee) affect youth worldwide, but are \\nparticularly common in post-conflict or disaster settings. The accumulation \\nof these and other risk factors give rise to the greater likelihood of developing \\nmental-health conditions.  Many studies of mental health among youth \\nin low- and middle-income countries have documented the elevated risk \\nof mental-health conditions in post-conflict or disaster settings. Post-\\ntraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is particularly common in these \\nsettings, and contributes to subsequent adjustment problems \\nand considerable disability. \\nCertain youth are at particular risk of mental-\\nhealth conditions.

This approach includes a range of preventive interventions spanning \\nmental-health promotion, universal prevention, selective interventions and \\nindicated interventions, each of which map onto different levels of risk. A \\nnumber of effective prevention models have been developed to address a \\nrange of risk factors at the level of the family, school, peer group, community \\nand workplace.

Multi-tiered prevention models for addressing \\nbehavioural and mental-health needs have also demonstrated promise in \\nseveral countries by targeting parents and the community.

This produces negative impacts, not only on service coordination \\nand delivery, but also on resource allocation and accountability (Kieling \\nand others, 2011). Such policies must require schools to both implement \\npreventive programming, such as training in social-emotional learning and \\npositive behaviour supports, and to promote the integration of the full \\ncontinuum of prevention programs and mental-health services.  \\nEfforts are needed to overcome stigma  regarding mental-health \\nconditions in youth across their life course.

The vast majority of countries allocate less than 1 per cent of their \\nhealth budgets to mental health (Saxena, Thornicroft, Knapp and Whiteford, \\n2007), leading to a treatment gap of more than 75 per cent in many low- \\nand middle-income countries (Saxena and others, 2007; World Federation \\nfor Mental Health, 2011; World Health Organization, 2011).

On a global level, it is estimated \\nthat approximately 20 per cent of youth, namely, well over one billion youth, \\nexperience a mental-health condition each year (Patel, Flisher and others, \\n2007; United Nations Children’s Fund, 2012).  In fact, young people are \\nat the greatest risk of a range of mental-health conditions during their \\ntransition from childhood to adulthood (Kessler and others, 2005), due, \\nin large part, to the host of physical, psychological and emotional changes \\nwhich occur during this vulnerable period.  Epidemiological research \\nsuggests that the majority of individuals with mental-health conditions first \\nexperience symptoms prior to age 24 (Kessler and others, 2005). \\nThere is also considerable burden and disability associated with mental-\\nhealth conditions. Although much of the epidemiological research \\nsupporting these estimates comes from high-income countries, studies \\nfrom low- and middle-income countries provide similar prevalence \\nestimates (Kieling and others, 2011). Mental-health conditions negatively \\nimpact youths’ development, quality of life and ability to fully participate \\nin their communities (Fisher and Cabral de Mello, 2011).  Mental and \\nbehavioural conditions are the leading causes of ill-health in young people \\nin both high- and low-resource countries, accounting for one third of all \\nyears lost in productivity due to disability (World Health Organization, \\n2008b).  Suicide is the fifth highest cause of death in this age group \\nglobally and second highest in high-income countries (Blum and Nelson-\\nMmari, 2004). Among youth between the ages of 15-24, 17 per cent of all \\ndisability-adjusted life years are due to mental and behavioural disorders, \\nwith an additional 4.5 per cent due to self-harm and 5 per cent due to other \\nneurological disorders (Murray and others, 2012).  Table 1 shows the main \\ncauses of disability by mental-health condition among youth.  \\nAcross all age groups, the proportion of DALYs due to mental disorders \\nhas increased by an estimated 38 per cent since 1990, and it is expected that \\nthis burden will continue to rise (Murray and others, 2012). Mental-health \\nconditions are associated with behavioural health risks such as substance \\nuse, unsafe sexual behaviour and violence (Patel, Araya and others, 2007), \\nincreased risk of communicable and non-communicable diseases, injury and \\nall-cause mortality (Prince and others, 2007). Mental-health conditions \\nperpetuate a negative cycle of poverty and social exclusion (Lund and \\nothers, 2011). They impact work-related performance negatively, including \\nemployability, work performance, hours worked and overall work-related \\nproductivity (Kessler and Frank, 1997). Taken together, these data illustrate \\nthe significant impairment, disability and disease burden associated \\nwith mental-health conditions (Muñoz, Le, Clarke, and Jaycox, 2002). \\nTherefore, the prevention of mental-health conditions must be a global \\npublic-health priority.\\n3 The World Bank classifies countries into three categories (low, middle, or high income) based \\non the gross national income per capita.

One \\narea that can be impacted by mental-health conditions during adolescence \\nand young adulthood is the development of safe and healthy relationships \\nwith peers, parents, teachers and romantic partners. In fact, adolescence is \\nthe developmental period that is critical for identity formation and taking on \\nroles, especially with peers. Many mental-health conditions negatively affect \\na youths’ ability to successfully form supportive and healthy relationships \\nand manage conflict within these relationships. For example, at least one in \\nfour adolescents experiences symptoms of depression (Kessler and others, \\n2005), which commonly includes irritability, anger and avoidance of social \\ninteraction.  These symptoms can lead youth to withdraw from others as well \\nas be rejected by their peers, which can exacerbate depressive symptoms \\nfurther and limit opportunities for social skills development. Similar social \\nchallenges occur for youth with anxiety, whereby they tend to avoid social \\ninteraction and may be rejected by their peers because of their anxious \\nbehaviour. \\nAggressive youth and those with attention deficit disorder/hyperactivity \\nproblems often experience rejection by peers because their behaviour is \\nperceived as aversive by pro-social peers (Stormshak and others, 1999). \\nThis often results in a cascade process, whereby the rejected aggressive \\nyouth spend time with delinquent peers and become disengaged from the \\nacademic process, which exacerbates their behavioural and mental-health \\nconditions (Lynne-Landsman, Bradshaw and Ialongo, 2010; Patterson, \\nDeBaryshe and Ramsey, 1989). \\nAnother common mental-health concern among youth is substance \\nuse.  A recent study of students attending the eighth to the tenth grade \\nin South Africa (Reddy and others, 2010) indicated that 10 per cent of \\nyouth who had tried cannabis were introduced before they were 13 years \\nold, with roughly 30 per cent smoking daily. It was found that substance use \\nwas strongly correlated with repeating a school grade and a range of other \\nnegative outcomes, such as physical injury, crime, sexual violence and risky \\nsexual behaviour (Reddy and others, 2010). \\nMental-health conditions affect youths’ self-esteem, social interaction, \\nand even, their chances of personal injury and harming themselves and \\nothers (Bradshaw, Rebok and others, 2012). Y outh with untreated mental-\\nhealth conditions struggle to succeed in school. Academic problems include \\nlow engagement, poor academic performance, learning disabilities, discipline \\nproblems (e.g. suspension), poor attendance and, eventually, school dropout \\n(Bradshaw, O’Brennan and McNeely, 2008). This trajectory of poor \\nacademic engagement leads to diminished workforce readiness and inability \\nto transition to work and employment which, in turn, impacts independent \\nliving and social integration negatively (Bradshaw, Schaeffer, Petras, and'),\n",

As they near, and enter, adulthood, youth with mental-\\nhealth conditions face poor transition outcomes, especially into the world \\nof work. Integration into society, including the workplace, is key to their \\nsuccessful transition to working life (Bradshaw, Rebok and others, 2012). \\nCULTUrAL AND CONTExTUAL CONSIDErATIONS\\nConsideration of the mental-health needs of youth globally must include the \\ncultures and contexts in which youth live.  The way people experience life \\nemotionally and the way in which they behave in relation to other people, \\ndiffers from one culture to another. Culture affects mental health by providing \\ncontent for its expression, yielding different forms of expression in different \\ncultures even for the same mental-health conditions. Cultural differences \\naffect the risk and resiliency factors that relate to mental-health conditions, \\nthereby influencing prevalence and incidence rates across cultures. Culture \\nshould thus have an impact on the selection and adaptation of appropriate \\nprevention and intervention strategies (Bass and others, 2012).  \\nLocally-based, culturally-defined descriptions of symptoms, definitions \\nand social impacts provide understanding of the ways in which populations \\nassign meaning to mental-health conditions; likewise, cross-cultural, global \\nstudies provide an understanding of the manner in which conditions occur, \\nvary and respond to intervention across populations. An example of how \\nthe expression and understanding of mental-health conditions can vary \\nby culture can be found within research on variations of panic attack, or \\nepisodes of extreme anxiety.  In the United States of America, panic attacks \\nare often characterized by heart palpitations and shortness of breath – two \\nsigns that indicate to the person, and others around them, that they are \\npanicked. In a study of Khmer refugees, the researchers found that the most \\nprominent symptoms of panic attack included dizziness and neck tension \\n(Bass and others, 2012). Research from Nigeria found that the feeling of \\n‘extreme heat’ in the head was a common way of describing a panic \\nattack. In some Latin American cultures, the trembling of \\nlimbs, or feeling of ‘nerves’, is most common (Bass and \\nothers, 2012).  This is not to suggest that these different \\nsymptoms show up only in each of these cultures: \\nmany people experiencing panic attacks have heart \\npalpitations, dizziness and nervousness. Rather, \\nthe point is that it is necessary to recognize that \\ndifferent cultures may describe the presenting \\nsymptoms differently. This is relevant to all \\ndomains of public mental health, including \\ntalking to people about these problems (i.e. \\npsycho-education), adapting and advertising \\nservices, and designing appropriate assessment \\ntools for epidemiologic and services research \\n(Bass and others, 2012).\\nIsa Gueye'),\n",

It is particularly important during the period of later adolescence \\nand early adulthood for understanding the difference between appropriate, \\nrelevant, social functioning roles and social behaviour, and those considered \\nproblematic. When confronted with individuals suffering from mental-\\nhealth conditions in their communities, local friends, relatives and \\nneighbours often know at an intuitive level that the sufferer is not well, but \\nknow neither exactly what the problem is nor the source of the symptoms. \\nIn fact, mental-health conditions often sit on the social line between the \\nnormal and the abnormal.\\nCulture can also influence the mechanisms by which different risk and \\nresiliency factors affect the prevalence, course and outcome of different \\nmental-health conditions and the ways in which cultural conditions create \\ncircumstances that promote mental health (Bass and others, 2012). One \\nway in which culture has a direct impact on the experience of mental-health \\nconditions is in its interaction with factors such as gender, age, marital status \\nand poverty. \\nY et, there are some universals. Gender has been repeatedly shown to be \\nimportant when investigating mental-health conditions. Across cultures, it \\nhas been shown that females experience higher rates of mood and anxiety \\nconditions while males show higher rates of substance use, conduct- and \\naggression-related problems (Bradshaw, Rebok and others, 2012).  Age, \\nlike gender, acts as an important predictor across cultures for variations \\nin mental illness, but there is considerable local specificity in the types \\nof mental illness that occur in different age groups. For example, in poor, \\nurban, non-Western settings, youth often report increased depression \\nand aggressive behaviour as a result of the lack of—real or perceived—life \\nchances due to poverty and unemployment. In contrast, youth within \\nmiddle-class communities in the United States of America are being \\ndiagnosed increasingly with depression, ADHD and drug dependency for \\nan entirely different—and not entirely clear—set of culturally-mediated \\nreasons (Bass and others, 2012).\\npOvErTY AND MENTAL HEALTH\\nThe WHO report on Mental Health and Development (2010a) highlighted \\nthe risks of a cyclical relationship between vulnerability and poor mental \\nhealth, in which people with mental-health conditions are a vulnerable \\ngroup subject to stigma, discrimination, violence, marginalization and other \\nviolations of their human rights. However, these same contextual factors \\nthat support the designation of those with mental-health conditions \\nas a vulnerable group also indicate a heightened risk for exacerbation or \\ndevelopment of further mental and emotional problems, through an injured \\nsense of self, increased isolation, exposure to violence and other violations \\nof human rights (World Health Organization, 2010a).'),\n",

People \\nliving in poverty experience high rates of stress and trauma, social exclusion, \\nmalnutrition and poor health care, which heighten the risk and severity of \\ncommon mental disorders.  Those with mental-health conditions may also be \\nat higher risk of poverty due to the cost of care, stigma and social exclusion, \\nand fewer opportunities for employment and education (Lund and others, \\n2010).  In addition to these general factors exacerbating poor mental health, \\nthere are more specific circumstances – often overlooked – which have great \\nnegative impacts on youth mental well-being. For example, youth who are \\nhomeless, orphaned or abandoned, youth in the juvenile justice system or \\nyouth in care systems are all more likely to experience the aggravation of an \\nexisting mental-health condition.  Each is considered in greater detail below. \\nHOMELESS, STrEET-INvOLvED YOUTH AND MENTAL HEALTH\\nHomeless youth often have more risk of mental-health conditions than their \\nresident counterparts. Y outh may undergo chaotic and violent home lives \\nbefore they become homeless and may be distrustful of authority and adults \\n(Sherman, 1992).  Many of the factors leading to young people becoming \\nhomeless or street youth such as poverty, discrimination, disability, domestic \\nviolence or abuse, drug use, lack of educational opportunities, armed conflict \\nor other incident leading to mass migration and loss of caregivers, are the \\nsame factors that already elevate the risk of mental-health conditions \\n(Beazley, 2003).  In addition to the factors contributing to the youth’s initial \\nhomeless status, the stress of being homeless can exacerbate pre-existing \\nmental-health conditions. Once on the street, youth with mental-health \\nconditions continue to experience discrimination, marginalization, violence \\nand exploitation.  They also encounter barriers to accessing education and \\nhealth care, may suffer from learning disabilities, police harassment and \\nrisk being institutionalized (West, 2003).  While recognized as victims by \\nmany, homeless youth are often viewed as a plague on society not only \\nby community members but also by legal and social systems. In the worst \\ncases, this may lead to persecution and murder of homeless street youth by \\nvigilante groups with little reprisal from the authorities (Scanlon and others, \\n1998; Wernham, 2004).\\nAs a result of the hardships of street life, homeless youth may experience \\nproblems with identity and self-esteem, symptoms of trauma and difficulty \\nintegrating into society (West, 2003). These children, lacking positive \\nadult relationships and socialization, are at risk of developing maladaptive \\ncoping strategies, antisocial survival behaviour and poor mental health \\n(Kombarakaran, 2006).  In low- and middle-income countries, an estimated \\n60 per cent of street youth report lifetime drug use, most commonly \\ninhalants, tobacco, alcohol and marijuana.  Substance abuse is associated with \\nother health problems in this group, including high-risk sexual behaviour, \\npositive HIV status, physical complaints and depressive symptoms (Embleton \\nIncarceration\\nMind incarceration \\ntrapped and lost in  \\nmy Mind!\\nThey see me but  \\nthey don’t\\nThey know me but  \\nthey don’t\\nHell!!

In Toronto, one third \\nof homeless youth reported a pre-existing mental-health condition \\nand, in focus groups, voiced the complex dynamics of mental-health \\nproblems resulting from both long-term issues as well as the stressors of \\nhomelessness (McCay and others, 2010).  Brazilian youth who were drawn \\nto street life were more positive about it than youth who were driven to \\nthe street due to home circumstances (Raffaelli and others, 2000; 2001). \\nY outh who experienced sexual harassment on the street or abuse at police \\nstations have higher levels of hopelessness than their fellow street youth \\n(Duyen, 2005).  Y outh who become homeless or enter street life due to \\npolitical conflict, rather than poverty, may also experience higher levels \\nof traumatic symptoms such as headaches, nightmares, bad memories \\nand anxiety, brought about by the conflict and subsequent breakdown \\nof social structures; the dynamics of gender and conflict may present \\nadditional challenges for social reintegration into care systems (Vealea \\nand Donab, 2003).     \\nGender roles and contextual factors influence the plight and outcomes \\nof homeless and street youth.  For example, in Kenya, gender differences on \\nhow children are socialized to survive poverty help boys become street savvy \\nat a young age, while girls who resort to street life represent “… a broken \\npath of development. …” (Aptekar and Ciano-Federoff, 1999, p. 44).  Once \\non the street, boys appear to be better-adjusted than girls, with active social \\nnetworks, loyalty and continued relationships with their mothers, whereas girls \\nfare worse emotionally, are more socially isolated and do not maintain contact \\nwith their families (Aptekar and Ciano-Federoff, 1999).  This scenario does \\nnot play out in Brazil, however, where there are similar gender differences in \\nthe cause of homelessness, but where girls appear to fare just as well as boys \\nin meeting their basic needs on the street, potentially due to the variety of \\ngovernmental and non-governmental service organizations available to them \\nin Brazil that are not available in Kenya (Rafaelli and others, 2000).\\nThe circumstances of street life have profound implications for youths’ \\nsocial, emotional and cognitive development.  However, street youth facing \\nextreme adversity are remarkably adaptive and develop coping mechanisms \\nto survive—and sometimes even thrive—in these circumstances (Koller \\nand Hutz, 2001).  They develop protective friendship networks and \\nsocial relationships, learn to manoeuvre through police harassment and \\nexploitation, and utilise available social services (Kombarakaran, 2004).  \\nThey may keep contact with family members and supplement household \\nincome (Aptekar and Ciano-Federoff, 1999).

Bullying typically occurs in situations where there is \\na power or status difference (Gladden and others, 2014; Olweus, 1993). \\nIn high-income countries, bullying represents a significant and worrisome \\nproblem for many school-aged youth, as it is one of the most common \\nforms of aggression and victimization experienced by school-aged children \\n(Nansel and others, 2001). The prevalence of frequent involvement in \\nbullying appears to increase in late elementary school, peak during middle \\nschool, and decline in high school (Olweus, 1993). As a result, much of the \\nresearch on bullying has focused on middle-school-aged youth. \\nWHO has been assessing rates of bullying across the globe since the \\nlate 1990s (Craig and others, 2009). The WHO study of 40 developing \\ncountries showed that the rate of youth exposure to bullying ranged from \\n8.6–45.2 per cent among boys and 4.8–35.8 per cent among girls. \\nAlthough there is a growing body of research across the globe suggesting \\nthat frequent involvement in bullying can have pervasive, long-lasting \\neffects on children’s social and emotional functioning (Nansel and others, \\n2001), including externalizing and internalizing problems (O’Brennan, \\nBradshaw, and Sawyer, 2009), these effects tend to vary as a function \\nof the youth’s pattern of involvement in bullying. Generally speaking, the \\nresearch suggests that youth that are involved in bullying both as perpetrator \\nand target evince the most serious types of behavioural and mental-health \\nconditions (Bradshaw, O’Brennan, and Sawyer,  2008; Bradshaw and \\nothers, 2013; O’Brennan, Bradshaw and Sawyer, 2009). A recent study \\nindicated that bully victims are over 12 times as likely as non-bullied youth \\nto be a member of a gang, and nearly 13 times more likely to have carried a \\nweapon (Bradshaw, Waasdorp and others, 2013).  These findings highlight \\nthe mental-health risk associated with bullying.\\nADvErSE AND TrAUMATIC EvENTS IN CHILDrEN AND YOUTH \\nA growing body of research documents the link between adverse life events \\nand a variety of mental-health conditions (Jordanova and others, 2007). \\nCross-sectional and longitudinal studies of adverse life events have shown \\nan association with mental-health conditions (Kessler, 1997). Research has \\nfound that most episodes of depression, perhaps as many as 50 per cent, \\nare preceded by a major life event (Kessler, 1997). The psychological toll \\nclaimed by stress also plays a role in the etiology of other mental-health \\nconditions such as PTSD and anxiety.\\nResearch consistently suggests that stressful life events—both major and \\nminor—often precede the onset of depression, and that an accumulation of \\nstressors can have a graded relationship with the severity of the resulting \\nEnd BPD \\n(Bipolar Depression)\\n“Does happiness even \\nexist?” I struggled, \\nsobbed, kicked and \\nfought my way out of \\nmy mind throughout \\nmy childhood, until one \\nday I was officially \\ndiagnosed with \\nborderline personality \\ndisorder and MDD.

Some studies \\nhave found that males are more likely than females to experience traumas \\nsuch as witnessing violence or physical assault, while females are more \\nlikely to experience sexual violence (Foster, Kuperminc and Price 2004; \\nHanson and others, 2008), however, some have found no difference \\nbetween sexes in terms of types of traumas experienced (Giaconia and \\nothers, 1995).\\nY outh in urban settings and those belonging to minority groups may be \\nat increased risk of experiencing traumas (Abram and others, 2004; Foster, \\nKuperminc and Price, 2004; Garbarino, Bradshaw and Vorrasi, 2002). \\nThose youth, whose parents or caregivers have low socioeconomic status, \\nhave also been found to be at increased risk (Cox, Kotch and Everson, \\n2003). Recent studies of youth and adolescents have found that the vast \\nmajority of individuals are more likely to experience multiple life-threatening \\nor terrifying events than a single traumatic event (Briggs and others, 2013; \\nSuliman and others, 2009). A clinical study in the United States among \\nchildren who had experienced trauma found that 77 per cent had reported \\nmore than one type of exposure and 31 per cent had experienced five or \\nmore types of trauma (Briggs and others, 2013). Exposure to violence can \\nimpact youths’ mental health, well-being and ability to develop healthy \\nrelationships.  The recent study of students in the eighth to tenth grade \\nin South Africa (Reddy and others, 2010) found that youth are facing \\ndifficult issues such as increased exposure to crime and violence, inequality \\nand poverty. As a consequence, mental-health conditions and behavioural \\nproblems are becoming more prevalent in that country.\\nResearch has demonstrated that experiencing these traumatic events \\nincreases the risk of developing a range of mental-health conditions in youth, \\nincluding PTSD, depression and anxiety disorders (Briggs and others, 2013; \\nDyregrov and Yule, 2006; Giaconia and others, 1995; Pine and Cohen, \\n2002).

Similarly, Elklit (2002) reported a nine \\nper cent lifetime prevalence among adolescents in a representative sample \\nin Denmark. Many studies of PTSD are conducted in post-disaster settings, \\neither man-made or natural (Dyregrov and Yule, 2006). The estimates of \\nPTSD among these samples are more highly varied than the community \\nsamples.

Sustained exposure to trauma during the developmental years \\nof adolescence can be especially problematic because it may affect the \\ndevelopment of the central nervous and neuroendocrine systems adversely \\n(Dyregrov and Yule, 2006; Van der Kolk, 2003).\\nCONFLICT AND pOST-CONFLICT MENTAL HEALTH\\nMany studies of mental-health conditions among youth in low- and \\nmiddle-income countries have focused on post-conflict or disaster settings. \\nExposure to war and conflict remains one of the greatest risk factors for \\nPTSD and other mental-health conditions among adolescents (Attanayake \\nand others, 2009; Barenbaum, Ruchkin and Schwab-Stone, 2004). In \\nconflict settings, children and adolescents often have disproportionately \\nhigher rates of morbidity and mortality compared with adults (Attanayake \\nand others, 2009; Bellamy, 2005).\\nThe types of trauma experienced in these settings may be quite different \\nfrom those experienced by adolescents in community samples, and have been \\nfound to include: combat situations, being forced into the role of child soldier, \\nfleeing or being forced from their homes, witnessing violence – particularly \\nthe death of loved ones and the loss of parents or caregivers (Attanayake and \\nothers, 2009; Machel, 1996; Wexler, Branski and Kerem, 2006; Mollica and'),\n",

Many studies on children affected by conflict \\nfocus on PTSD, with fewer including diagnoses of anxiety \\nand depression and almost none focusing on psychotic disorders \\n(Attanayake and others, 2009; Jordans and others, 2009). Clearly, \\nPTSD is an important outcome to measure in such settings, yet the lack \\nof data on other mental-health conditions in these contexts is a significant \\nlimitation in the field, and an area in which future research should be \\nconcentrated.\\nChildren displaced by war represent an acutely vulnerable group and may \\nbe at increased risk of suffering mental-health conditions (Fazel and others, \\n2012; Heptinstall, Sethna and Taylor, 2004; Reed and others, 2012). A review \\nby Reed and colleagues (2012) of refugee and displaced children resettled \\nin low- and middle-income countries focused on risk and protective factors \\nassociated with mental health among this population.

Females tended to have a higher risk for internalizing symptoms, \\nsuch as depression and anxiety, than males (Mels and others, 2010; Sujoldzić \\nand others, 2006; Van Ommeren and others, 2001).\\nAdditional risk factors for mental-health conditions included parental \\npsychiatric problems (Angel, Hjern and Ingleby, 2001), repeated exposure \\nto violence (Ellis and others, 2008) and prolonged residence in refugee \\ncamps.   A review by Tol, Song and Jordans (2013) of studies on resilience \\nin children affected by war in low- and middle-income countries found that \\nindividual coping strategies (Fernando and Ferrari, 2011), positive self-\\nperception (Kryger and Lindgren, 2011) and perseverance and self-esteem \\n(Betancourt and others, 2011) were protective factors for mental health \\nproblems.  Family-level factors, including family connectedness (Sujoldzic \\nand others, 2006) and family cohesion (Berthold, 1999; Sujoldzic and \\nothers, 2006) have also been found to be protective.\\nChildren displaced by war may be resettled in high-income countries \\nthat have greater resources for mental-health care than their home \\ncountry; however, there are additional challenges that may affect their \\nmental health adversely in these settings (Fazel and others, 2012).

There is evidence that the end of conflict brings a \\nnatural reduction in post-traumatic symptoms among some children (Laor \\nand others, 1997; Punamäki, Qouta, and El-Sarraj, 2001); however, many \\nchildren may have severe symptoms that may persist for years without \\ntreatment (Dyregrov, Gjestad and Raundalen, 2002; Kinzie and others, \\n1989; Kuterovac, 2003). Finding appropriate service mechanisms for \\nchildren affected by conflict is therefore critical, especially given that some \\nstudies have indicated that mental-health conditions related to the conflict \\nmay not present themselves until later in life, and may affect the child’s \\nprogress through adolescence and adulthood (Barenbaum and others, \\n2004; Cohen, Brom and Dasberg, 2001). Systematic reviews (Barenbaum \\nand others, 2004) have emphasized the need for programmes (including \\nboth assessment and treatment) to be developed and sustained within the \\nhome countries of adolescents affected by war. Increasingly, efforts are \\nbeing made to develop interventions for children affected by conflict. A \\nrecent meta-analysis by Peltonen and Punamäki (2010), however, found \\nthat, while a number of programmes appeared to lower both PTSD and \\ndepression symptoms, many studies employed weak designs and few \\nfocused on multiple domains of child development and psychosocial well-\\nbeing.

A systematic review of epidemiological \\nstudies conducted in low- and middle-income countries with non-referral \\nsamples found the prevalence of mental-health conditions among children \\nand adolescents to range from 10 per cent to 20 per cent, a range consistent \\nwith that observed in high-income countries (Kieling and others, 2011).\\nMany of the risk factors associated with mental-health conditions \\namong adolescents in low- and middle-income countries are shared with \\nadolescents in high-income countries, including genetic risk factors, physical \\nhealth status and the physical and mental health of parents or caregivers, \\nespecially maternal mental health (Benjet, 2010; Kieling and others, 2011; \\nZashikhina and Hagglof, 2007).

The Child \\nAtlas Project conducted by the World Health Organization indicated that \\nfunding for mental-health resources was rare in low- and middle-income \\ncountries, and that the majority of countries participating in the survey had \\nno governmental body responsible for mental-health care (Belfer, 2008; \\nKieling and others, 2011).

Traditionally, services for young people suffering from mental-health \\nconditions have been grossly inadequate.  Moreover, when these services \\nare available, the rates of service utilization by youth with mental-health \\nconditions have been low. The fear of social exclusion and stigmatization \\nprevents young people from seeking help and utilizing services. The section \\nconcludes that interventions which support youth in all aspects of their life \\n- family, school, place of work, and community - are vital for addressing \\nmental-health conditions in young people.  \\nDespite the high prevalence of mental-health conditions and the \\npreponderance of risk factors for these problems among children and \\nadolescents, mental-health services for this population are often insufficient \\nor go under-utilized (Blanco and others, 2008; Eisenberg, Hunt, and Speer, \\n2012; Leaf and others, 1996; Zwaanswijk and others, 2003).

Help is more often sought for boys in \\nchildhood and early adolescence and for girls in late \\nadolescence (Boldero and Fallon, 1995; Zwaanswijk and \\nothers, 2003). Another factor is parental education, such \\nthat the children of parents with higher levels of education \\nwere more likely to receive services than children of parents \\nwith less education (Farmer and others, 1999; Zwaanswijk and \\nothers, 2003).  Cultural factors may also play a role in help-seeking \\nbehaviour among young people (Barker, Olukoya and Aggleton, 2005) and \\nmay partially account for differences in help-seeking and service utilization \\nrates across countries. These cultural factors may include the way in which \\nthe mental-health condition is perceived by the child and his/her caregiver, \\nand the stigma associated with the mental-health condition or with seeking \\ntreatment for it (Barker, Olukoya and Aggleton, 2005; Cauce and others, \\n2002; Michelmore and Hindley, 2012).\\nAdolescents often feel inclined to deal with mental-health conditions \\ncompletely on their own, with no support from anyone (Sheffield, \\nFironeza and Sofronoff, 2004).  When they do seek assistance, children \\nand adolescents tend to use more informal service systems (Sheffield \\nFironeza and Sofronoff, 2004), often first seeking counsel of family and \\nfriends before considering help from professionals, especially for emotional \\nproblems (Boldero and Fallon, 1995; Rickwood and others, 2005). In a \\nstudy of young people in Australia, researchers found that parents, friends \\nand teachers were three of the most important sources of help among those \\nwith a mental-health condition (Rickwood and others, 2005). Although \\nsocial support from family and friends has been found to be protective \\nfor a number of health problems in literature, these resources may not be \\nadequate for serious mental-health conditions experienced by young people \\n(Walcott and Music, 2012).  In trying to improve service utilization among \\nyouth, it is thus important to keep in mind that they often prefer to seek \\nhelp from these informal sources, and to develop formal services around \\nthese support systems so as to increase utilization. Options may include \\nschool-based programmes (Mason-Jones and others, 2012; Walcott and \\nMusic, 2012), parental educational initiatives about mental health (Power \\nand others, 2005) and interventions that include the child’s natural support \\nsystems, such as parents or other family (Coatsworth and others, 2001). \\nAs indicated throughout the present report, early intervention is critical, \\nas mental-health conditions in youth are strongly associated with mental-\\nhealth disorders later in life (Kim-Cohen and others, 2003).\\nZia Lim'),\n",

The \\nresources are considerably more limited in low- and middle-income countries, \\nwhere young people face additional barriers to care: the ambiguously-defined \\nperiod of ‘adolescence’ is often categorized – for service provision purposes \\n– with either children or adults, rather than recognizing emerging adulthood \\nas a unique developmental stage (Patel and others, 2007).  In addition, help-\\nseeking behaviour comes less readily to young people, who may be even more \\ninfluenced by stigma, embarrassment and lack of basic knowledge about \\nmental health (Saxena and others, 2007).\\nHealth disparities do exist globally wherever any economic, social and \\ncultural barrier limits access to care further. When young people do access \\nformal mental-health or support services, these programmes may be \\nprovided through schools, community-based organizations, Government \\nprogrammes (such as foster care, juvenile justice and social security), and \\nother systems (Podmostko, 2007). Services provided to youth are often \\ninfluenced more by the point of entry into the maze of systems rather \\nthan the youth’s actual needs. For example, the authors discussed different \\npotential responses to a depressed adolescent with truancy issues: whereas \\na mental-health service would address the depression primarily through \\ncounselling, the school system might instead pursue a truancy action. Since \\neach system has its own procedures, terminology and eligibility criteria \\n(Podmostko, 2007), service providers unfamiliar with external resources \\nwill draw, typically, only from their own system, creating tunnels of service \\nprovision from which it is difficult to diverge. The result is inefficiency, due \\nto poorly-coordinated mental-health services rather than a comprehensive \\nsystem of care that would enable youth to receive the most appropriate \\nservices available (Ross and Miller, 2005).  Furthermore, the authors \\npoint out that the system response to youth is influenced by cultural and \\ninstitutional factors, such as differential response by race, again resulting in \\nservices driven by external priorities or bias, rather than by individual needs.\\nService inefficiency is exacerbated further during youths’ transition \\nto adulthood, as service provision during this time is influenced more by \\ninstitutional and bureaucratic guidelines than the developmental needs of \\nyouths and young adults (Davis, 2003; Patel and others, 2007).  As the \\ndiagnostic and age criteria for programme eligibility vary between systems, \\nyoung people ageing out of youth programmes encounter discontinuity in \\nservice eligibility, with gaps or ‘transition cliffs’ in which the same person \\nis classified as a youth in one system but as an adult in another.  This lack \\nof standardized practice across systems may cause disruption in important \\nmental-health services and loss of support and progress during a crucial \\nperiod of development (Davis, 2003; Podmostko, 2007).'),\n",

However, this likelihood may have \\ndifferent impacts on youth with and without mental-health conditions: \\nyouth with a physical or mental disability on public insurance are less likely \\nto lose insurance eligibility than their counterparts without a disability, \\nwhereas the opposite is true for youth with private health insurance (Wang, \\nGrembowski and Watts, 2010). This may be due to eligibility pathways for \\npublic funding that prioritize individuals with identified health needs, while \\nyouth with disabilities who age out of their parents’ health coverage face \\nadditional barriers, related either to lack of awareness about public service \\noptions or to decreased access to employer-based plans due to the high \\nlevel of unemployment and low educational achievement in these groups \\n(Wang, Grembowsi and Watts, 2010).    \\nAs discussed previously, difficulties in accessing services may be \\ncompounded for youth in rural or low-resource areas, due to factors such \\nas poverty, low service availability, lack of transportation and heightened \\nstigma (Heflinger and Hoffman, 2009; World Health Organization, 2003). \\nThese factors may not only serve as barriers to care, but may also contribute \\nto a higher proportion of youth at high risk for transition problems in these \\nareas (Heflinger and Hoffman, 2009).

This poor \\nfit is a particular concern in the case of youth with delayed psychosocial \\ndevelopment (Davis, 2003).

For example, a recent study compared outcomes \\nfor foster-care youth with special educational needs enrolled in either a \\ntraditional transitional living programme or a self-determination mentoring \\nprogramme (Powers and others, 2012).

Multiple \\nframeworks have been put forth to characterize both the public-health \\napproach to prevention (e.g. Mrazek and Haggerty, 1994; O’Connell, \\nBoat and Warner, 2009), and the continuum from health promotion to \\ntreatment (O’Connell, Boat and Warner, 2009; Weisz and others, 2005). \\nThese models are gaining increased recognition and some traction in diverse \\nservice settings, including education, juvenile justice and child welfare, in \\naddition to the more traditional areas of medicine and public health, all \\nwith the goal of preventing mental-health conditions. These public-health \\nmodels not only can be applied in multiple settings, but they also have \\nutility for preventing and addressing a range of behavioural and mental-\\nhealth conditions across the life course. \\nOne of the earliest public-health approaches to prevention put forth \\nby Caplan (1964) outlined primary, secondary and tertiary prevention. \\nSpecifically, primary prevention efforts aim to reduce or eliminate the \\nincidence of a particular disorder, whereas secondary prevention efforts \\nfocus on early identification and treatment of the disorder. Tertiary \\nprevention emphasizes the reduction of disorder-related impairment and \\ndisability.

In contrast, ‘treatment’ was to be used \\nfor the provision of services designed to reduce the symptoms of, or treat, \\nan existing disorder. Finally, the term ‘maintenance’ was to be used for care \\nthat enhanced rehabilitation and reduced the risk of recurrence following \\nresolution of an episode of acute mental disorder (Muñoz, Mrazek, and \\nHaggerty, 1996). The Institute of Medicine report also recommended the \\nadoption of a modified version of Gordon’s (1983) three-tiered prevention \\nframework for mental disorders, which advocated universal, selective, and \\nindicated preventive interventions:\\nUniversal preventive interventions target an entire population group \\n(e.g., campaigns and social media related to suicide prevention, smoking, \\nor youth violence; school-wide social-emotional curriculums to prevent \\nmental-health conditions).\\nSelective preventive interventions target high-risk subpopulations as \\ndetermined by biological, psychological, or social factors associated with \\nthe onset of a disorder (e.g. social-skills training for children of depressed \\nparents, cognitive behavioral approaches for adolescents with exposed to \\ntrauma).\\nIndicated preventive interventions target individuals at highest risk of \\ndeveloping the disorder based on subclinical signs that do not yet meet full \\ndiagnostic criteria (e.g. mood management for adolescents with elevated \\nanxiety symptoms (Muñoz, Mrazek and Haggerty, 1996).\\nIn an updated version of the original report by Mrazek and Haggerty \\n(1994), the Institute of Medicine expanded upon the three-tiered framework \\nto include the broader continuum, spanning mental-health promotion \\nthrough treatment  (see figure 1; O’Connell, Boat and Warner, 2009). \\nThey defined promotion as “efforts to enhance individuals’ ability to achieve \\ndevelopmentally-appropriate tasks (competence) and a positive sense of \\nself-esteem, mastery, well-being and social inclusion and to strengthen \\ntheir ability to cope with adversity” (p. 67). Mental-health promotion \\ngenerally targets entire populations within a particular setting (e.g. schools \\nor workplaces) and focuses on adaptive, positive aspects of functioning, \\nirrespective of risk. As displayed in figure 1, the prevention continuum in \\nmental health ranges from the promotion of positive mental health in the \\ngeneral population to the maintenance of treatment gains among those \\ntreated for mental-health conditions.

Home visiting generally involves regular \\nvisits to pregnant women or new mothers by health professionals such as \\nnurses and social workers. These programmes target a host of public-health \\nconcerns, such as pre-term delivery, low birth weight, infant mortality, \\nchild abuse and neglect, childhood injuries, parenting skills, intimate \\npartner violence and child and parent mental health. The randomized trials \\nof the Nurse–Family Partnership have demonstrated reduced behavioural \\nproblems and problem internalization during childhood in the child, as \\nwell as a decrease in maternal substance abuse and reduced early-onset \\nantisocial behaviour during the child’s adolescence. By age 19, the target \\ngirls had fewer children and were less likely to have been arrested or to have \\nbecome reliant on Medicaid than their peers who had not participated in \\nthe programme (Eckenrode and others, 2010). \\nThere exist other evidence-based, family-focused prevention models. \\nThe Positive Parenting Programme (otherwise known as Triple P) includes \\nfive levels of parent training: from an initial universal component using mass \\nmedia to disseminate information about effective parenting strategies, \\nto a selective-skills training component for the parents of children with \\nbehavioural problems, to an indicated component of up to 12 sessions for \\nparents with children manifesting serious behavioural problems. This third \\nlevel addresses such issues as marital problems and parental depression. \\nMultiple trials in the United States of America and Australia have found the \\noverall programme to be effective in reducing child behavioural problems \\n(Prinz and others, 2009). The Adolescent Transitions Programme applies \\na tiered, public-health framework to reduce and prevent adolescent \\nsubstance use and antisocial behaviour, which has universal, selective and \\nindicated components (Dishion and Kavanagh, 2003). Various versions of \\nthe programme have shown benefits for adolescents, such as reductions in \\naggressive behaviour, school problems and substance use. \\nAnother family-focused model is called Wraparound, as it intends \\nto support youth and families across multiple ecological contexts.  The \\ncomplexity of the system of service delivery, and the need to individualize \\nservices for each child, requires that a case manager, or care coordinator, be \\nassigned to help each family access services and assist the service providers \\nin their collaboration. All agencies involved, as well as the child and family, \\nmust participate actively in decision-making regarding the student’s care \\n(Burns and others, 2000). The team develops an individualized service plan \\nbased on a wraparound approach. The wraparound requires that services be \\nindividualized and child- and family-centred. In the wraparound process, a \\nchild is not simply placed into a pre-existing, categorical programme, but \\nrather, multiple services are tailored or created and wrapped around the \\nstudent’s individual needs and strengths.  As an individualized approach, this \\nprocess can be an important aspect of selective and indicated strategies and \\nis an extension of interventions provided and described above, in community'),\n",

Many prevention-\\noriented, school-based programmes are broad in scope, yielding a variety \\nof positive academic, emotional and behavioural outcomes for students \\nand schools. For this reason, the programmes reviewed in this section \\nare organized by level of prevention rather than by targeted outcome. \\nThe programmes span developmental periods, targeting students from \\npreschool to college.\\nAnother framework used worldwide is that of Social and Emotional \\nLearning, which promotes the processes of developing social and emotional \\ncompetencies in children (Collaborative for Academic, Social and \\nEmotional Learning, 2008). Social and Emotional Learning Programming \\nis based on the understanding that the best learning emerges in the context \\nof supportive relationships that make learning challenging, engaging and \\nmeaningful; social and emotional skills are critical to being a good student, \\ncitizen and worker; and many different kinds of risky behaviour (e.g. drug \\nuse, violence, bullying and dropout) can be prevented, or reduced, when \\nmulti-year, integrated efforts are used to develop students’ social and \\nemotional skills. This is best done through effective classroom instruction, \\nstudent engagement in positive activities both in and out of the classroom, \\nand broad parent and community involvement in programme planning, \\nimplementation and evaluation. \\nFive interrelated sets of cognitive, affective and behavioural \\ncompetencies have been developed: self-awareness, self-management, \\nsocial awareness, relationship skills and responsible decision-making.

A recent survey conducted by the World Health \\nOrganization to map available youth mental-health services provided by these \\ngroups found that – despite a variety of broader development programmes \\nthat did include them – psychosocial components tended to have narrower \\nobjectives and did not address youth mental health in a systematic manner; \\nnor was youth mental health incorporated into country-level strategies. There \\nwere several barriers to successful widespread implementation, including a \\nlack of informed guidelines and indicators, poor interagency collaboration, low \\nawareness and funding allocation, technical and human resource limitations \\nand the need for greater evidence on effective models of care (World Health \\nOrganization, 2012).\\nA major consequence of the failure to address youth mental health is \\nthat youth with mental-health conditions have continued to face additional \\nchallenges to their economic integration. Mental-health conditions restrict \\nyouths’ ability to engage, to complete their education and to obtain the \\ncritical skills needed for employment. This, in turn, puts them at increased \\nrisk of future unemployment.  The high rates of youth unemployment \\nglobally can also have a direct effect on youth mental health.  Research \\nhas found consistently that, when youth move from their educational stage \\nto the stage at which they expect to be employed, those who become \\nemployed have better mental-health status than those who were not able \\nto obtain employment (Fryer, 1997).  The extent to which this is because \\nemployment improves mental health, or because unemployment affects \\nmental health, varies by context.\\nClearly, the ages of 15-24 represent a key period of social and economic \\nintegration. However, the environment during a child’s first few years of \\nlife in the early stages of their neurological and social development forms \\nthe physical, social, cognitive and emotional foundation for subsequent \\ndevelopment. So providing the right conditions for healthy early development, \\nparticularly when considering prevention strategies that could reduce the \\nburden of mental health conditions during youth, is likely to be much more \\neffective than treating problems later.  Research has found that for children \\nin extreme circumstances, such as orphans or those living in extreme poverty, \\nweak foundations can create problems that lead to lifelong challenges in \\nlearning, problematic behaviour later in life, and potential long-term physical \\nand mental-health problems (Shonkoff, 2010).'),\n",

In low- and middle-\\nincome countries, the treatment gap often exceeds 75 per cent (Saxena \\nand others, 2007; World Federation for Mental Health, 2011; World \\nHealth Organization, 2011).  In high-resource settings, underfunded and \\nunequally-distributed programmes have contributed to these gaps, while \\nlow- and middle-income countries must also combat an overwhelming lack \\nof trained mental-health providers (Drew and others, 2011; Saxena and \\nothers, 2007; World Health Organization, 2003).  \\nLess than one third of low- and middle-income countries have a \\ndesignated youth mental-health entity.

Only 10 per cent of all \\nrandomized clinical trials on mental health among youth are based on \\ninterventions in low- and middle-income countries (Kieling, 2011). More \\nresearch in low- and middle-income settings is warranted. Additional \\nmodels for the integration of existing health services is needed within \\nthese settings, as mental-health services are scarce there (Kieling and \\nothers, 2011; Patel and others, 2013). In addition to increased prioritization \\nof mental health by Governments in low- and middle-income countries, \\nimproved integration of mental health into other systems of care for youth \\nwould increase cost-effectiveness and aid in reducing the strong stigma of \\npersons with mental-health conditions, two of the largest barriers to care \\nin low- and middle-income countries (Eisenberg and Belfer, 2009; Kieling \\nand others, 2011; Patel and others, 2013).

As a result, there is a great need for increased \\nfocus on prevention of mental-health conditions among youth. This includes \\ntargeting risk factors in early childhood that put youth at subsequent risk \\nof developing behavioural and mental-health conditions.
